  "instructions": "Trim bottom 2 inches off kale stems and  discard. Remove the center ribs by running a small, sharp knife down  either side of the rib of each leaf. Discard the rib and throw the leaf  portions into a bowl of cool water and rinse them well. Their nubbly  nature leaves all sorts of nooks and crannies for grit or bugs to hide.  Dry them well and slice the leaves into very thin ribbons chiffonade  style. You should have 4 to 5 cups. Place kale in a large bowl.Toast the bread slices in a toaster until golden. Tear them into  small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until mixture forms  coarse crumbs in a variety of sizes and shapes.Using a mortar and pestle to pound garlic into a paste. Add 1/4 cup  cheese, 1/4 cup oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, red pepper flakes  and pound them together further. Spoon the dressing over kale and toss  very well to thoroughly combine, it will be quite thick and will take a  lot of tossing to coat leaves.Let slaw sit for at least 5 minutes and up to overnight, then serve  topped with bread crumbs, marinated anchovies, additional cheese, a  drizzle of oil, and optional lemon slices.SERIOUS FUN FOODGreg HenrySippitySup",

Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish."

Wash and dry lettuce, then cut it however you like (I prefer chopping it into 1-inch pieces).                                  Open baguette by cutting it in half, cut each half into 1-inch croutons, and toss it with 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 clove minced garlic. Bake in the preheated oven until crunchy, about 10 minutes (be careful to make sure the garlic doesn't burn!). Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of finely grated Parmesan on top of the croutons, then put back in oven until the cheese is melted.                                  Assemble the salad by dressing the romaine to taste, mixing in the croutons and the grilled chicken, and topping with shaved Parmesan. Enjoy!",

Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish."

  "instructions": "1 Toast breadcrumbs: Toast crumbs in a little olive oil in a large skillet on medium high heat until lightly browned. Remove crumbs from skillet and set aside.2 Saut onions with garlic and anchovies: Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in the skillet on medium low heat. Add the onions, garlic, and anchovies.Crush the anchovies with the back of a spoon so that they smear well over the onions. Cook for 5 minutes, until the onions are soft. Remove the onions from the pan and set aside.While you are cooking the onions, put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for 2 quarts of water) for the pasta on the stove to boil.3 Saut cauliflower florets: Heat 4 Tbsp olive oil in theskillet on medium high heat. Add the cauliflower, stir infrequently, allowing the cauliflower edges to brown. Cook until the cauliflower florets are lightly browned, 3-5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes to the pan, and salt and pepper to taste.4 Add tomato paste, tomatoes, onion mixture:Dissolve tomato paste in 1/2 cup of water. Lower the heat to low. Add the tomato paste, tomatoes, onion, garlic, and anchovies, stir to combine well.Cook, uncovered, on low heat, until the cauliflower is tender. 5 Cook pasta, add to cauliflower mixture:Cook the pasta, uncovered, in salted boiling water until just al dente, according to the pasta package's cooking directions. Drain the pasta from the cooking water and add the cooked pasta to the cauliflower mixture.Stir in about half of the parsley, breadcrumbs, and Parmesan (leave the rest for garnish on top).Makes great leftovers as the flavors have more time to blend.",

Drizzle the eggs with 1 tablespoon of the oil and season with salt and pepper                                              Roast the tuna, vegetables and eggs in the center of the oven for 15 minutes, until the fish is slightly rare in the center and the egg whites are set, but the yolks are still runny.                                              Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the remaining 1/4 cup of oil with the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle the dressing over the vegetables and tuna steaks. Transfer to plates and serve immediately.",

  "instructions": "Remove most of the stems from rabe. Cut greens into 2 or 3 inch pieces. Boil and salt water. Blanche the greens for five minutes or so. Drain and set aside.                                   Heat three tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped garlic and anchovies, along with a good pinch of pepperonchino. Saute three minutes or so, until anchovies are dissolved.                                   Add rabe, stir and saute about 5 minutes so it soaks up the oil. Add a bit of salt. Add chicken broth and vinegar and saute, stirring as needed, till the rabe is tender but by no means mushy. There should be a bit of tasty liquid but not too much.                                   Boil orecchiete in salted water, watching like a hawk that it doesn't overcook. I recently bought very good orecchiette that was ready three minutes before the recommended cooking time. Drain pasta when done.                                   Combine pasta and rabe over medium heat for a minute or two. Check for salt. A bit of oil will not hurt.                                   Serve with generous grating of parmeggiano, a drizzle of oil, black pepper and a little fine sea salt.",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Chamisal Vineyards Monterey Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle."

    "pairingText": "Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine are great choices for Tuna. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Beringer Howell Mountain Bancroft Ranch Merlot with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle."

Reduce heat to healthy simmer and cook till one minute less than the package recommends. Add water or broth if needed. But remember, the broth should be thick, so add the least amount of liquid possible that still allows the pasta to cook.                                   When the pasta is done -- to my taste less done than usual -- spoon into bowls. Add grated parmesan, ground pepper and a few drops of good olive oil. Perfect.",

  "instructions": "1 In a very large bowl, whisk together the olive oil and garlic. Let sit for half an hour. 2 While the oil is sitting, make the croutons. Spread the baguette slices out over a baking sheet (may need to do in batches), lined with parchment paper or Silpat. Brush or spray with olive oil (or melted butter, or if you want garlicky croutons, dip pastry brush in the garlic infused oil you have sitting in step 1). Broil for a couple of minutes until the tops are lightly browned. (Note: do not walk away, these can easily go from browned to burnt.) Remove and let cool.The steps up until this point can be made ahead. 3 Add anchovies and eggs to the oil garlic mixture. Whisk until creamy. Add salt and pepper and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Whisk in half of the Parmesan cheese. Taste, add more lemon juice to taste. The lemon should give an edge to the dressing, but not overwhelm it. 4 Using your hands, tear off chunks of lettuce from the heads of lettuce (do not use a knife to cut). Add to the oil mixture and toss until coated. Add the rest of the Parmesan cheese, toss.5 Coarsely chop the toasted bread and add (with the crumbs from the chopping) to the salad. Toss. Serve immediately.",

    "pairingText": "Steak works really well with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Taltarni Three Monks Cabernet Merlot with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle."

In the meantime, bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Stir in a small fistful of salt and a splash of oil. Add the spaghetti and stir to prevent it from sticking together. Boil until the spaghetti is al dente. Lift the spaghetti out of the pot, reserving the pasta water, and place in the frying pan with the condimento. Toss the spaghetti with the condimento and a small ladleful of hot pasta water over high heat for 2 minutes, adding more hot pasta water if the spaghetti is dry or sticky. Transfer the spaghetti to a pasta bowl and serve immediately with grated Parmesan cheese.",

DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewhisk before using.                                    For fritters:                                        Sift flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt into medium bowl. Make well in center of flour mixture; add beer, egg yolks, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and lemon peel and whisk until well blended. Let batter stand at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours. Rewhisk before continuing.                                                                            Fill large bowl with water; add remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Using large knife, cut off top half of 1 artichoke, then cut off all but 3/4 inch of stem. Remove tough outer leaves until only 2 rows of tender green leaves remain in center. Using vegetable peeler, peel stem. Cut artichoke lengthwise in half. Using paring knife, cut out prickly choke in center; discard. Cut artichoke lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices; immediately place in lemon water. Repeat with remaining artichokes. Drain artichokes. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in large skillet over medium-low heat. Add artichokes and 1/2 cup tap water to skillet; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bring to boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until artichokes are tender and water evaporates, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and cool. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and chill.                                                                            Line large baking sheet with several layers of paper towels.

Pour enough canola oil into large saucepan to reach depth of 2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan; heat oil to 375F. Working in batches, drop artichoke mixture by tablespoonfuls into oil; fry until golden, turning often, about 2 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer fritters to paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Transfer fritters to platter; sprinkle with parsley. Garnish with lemon wedges. Serve sauce alongside.",

Add the wine, vinegar, and tomatoes with juice (breaking them up against the side of the pot as you go) and bring to a boil. Add the stock to cover (you may need a bit more than 3 cups). Put in the salt, bay leaf, thyme, bring to a boil. Simmer, partially covered, for 2-3 hours until the meat is tender. Cool to room temperature. Refrigerate.                                  When cool, skim off much of the fat from the top. Reheat over low heat, letting the stew simmer 30-45 minutes before serving.

    "pairingText": "Cod works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The GIFFT by Kathie Lee Gifford Pinot Grigio with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle."
  },
  "instructions": "Drain the fish, pat it dry, and break into pieces. Toss the baccala pieces in the flour to coat. Set aside.                          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.                          In a large saute pan, combine the olive oil and butter, and heat over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until very soft and browned, then add the anchovies and fish pieces. Cook over medium-high heat until the fish is nicely browned and the anchovies have fallen apart, 7 to 9 minutes. Add the chicken stock, bay leaves, pine nuts and sultanas and cook over high heat for 10 minutes. Top with the bread crumbs and cook in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the bread crumbs are browned. Serve hot.                          In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until smoking. Add all the chicken parts and brown all over, stirring to avoid burning. Remove the chicken and reserve. Add the carrots, onions, and celery to the pot and cook until soft and browned. Return the chicken to the pot and add 3 quarts of water, the tomato paste, peppercorns, and parsley. Stir with a wooden spoon to dislodge the browned chicken and vegetables bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring almost to a boil, then reduce heat and cook at a low simmer until reduced by half, about 2 hours, occasionally skimming excess fat. Remove from heat, strain, and press on the solids with the bottom of a ladle to extract out all liquids. Stir the stock to facilitate cooling and set aside. Refrigerate stock in small containers for up to a week or freeze for up to a month.",

  "instructions": "I broke down and bought draperies, real draperies, the kind that sound-, air-, and lightproof the rooms to create a cocoon of silence, suffocation, and darkness.  I do not like them; it now feels like we live in an antiseptic hotel, or worse, a funeral parlor.  And yet, they are necessary. They are thermal lined for insulation. The Northeast's got a chill on, that despite a few days' worth of traditional January thaw, is back.  I like the cold.  A lot.  But we woke to 12 degrees Fahrenheit the other morning, and the wind careening round the corners of our top-floor flat feels like it's scraping the bricks off the building.  This cold has teeth.What we need here is something we have to wait months for, the polar, if you will, opposite of dead car batteries, black ice, and daggered icicles poised over doorways.  What we need is summer, preferably the kind enjoyed in the Italian Mediterranean, where terra cotta walls radiate heat, geraniums radiate red, and fragrant pots of tomato sauce radiate from kitchen windows.Though terra cotta walls and geraniums, and even a kitchen window, are hard to come by at the moment, fragrant pots of tomato sauce are just about as easy as making cups of hot cocoa from scratch.The secret lies in flinging open the doors of your cupboards and fridge, and pulling out what happens to be on hand, what Simona of Briciole, mistress of Italian culinary and cultural linguistics, calls \"aglio, olio e peperoncino,\" (garlic, oil, and red chili pepper), which are likely ingredients bound to be available no matter what.  To many of us, a similarly simple sauce is more familiarly known as sugo alla puttanesca, named rather disparagingly after prostitutes or something of little value, from the word puttanata.  But I beg to differ with the popular urban legend of it.  Though this sauce is easy and fast, it can hardly be confused with cheap.Puttanesca Sauce - My own recipe, based on whatever I had on hand.  I did not use anchovies, although they are traditional. (Though I used yellow heirloom tomatoes, any fresh, high-quality variety of tomato is a wonderful thing in such an elegantly minimalist recipe.)Ingredients8 large tomatoes3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed1/4 cup pimento-stuffed green olives, sliced1/4 cup brine-cured black olives, sliced3 tablespoons capers, drained but not rinsed3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes1/4 teaspoon ground black pepperNo additional salt needed, especially if you add anchovies (2 tinned fillets, mashed in a mortar and pestle).MethodCore tomatoes.  Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.  Add tomatoes to water, and reduce temperature to simmer.  Watch for tomato skins to split and curl away, about 5 minutes.  Remove tomatoes carefully from hot water onto cutting board.  Allow to cool slightly, then peel tomatoes using a fork.  Discard skins.In a large saucepan, warm olive oil over low heat.  Add garlic and cook until fragrant but not brown (1 minute).   Add tomatoes, crushing them with a potato masher until they are broken down and juicy.  Add remaining ingredients and cook on a very low simmer for about 15 minutes.   Ladle sauce onto your favorite pasta.  Serves 3-4. --This post and recipe is, appropriately enough, being sent off to Simona of Briciole, hosting Weekend Herb Blogging #219 for Haalo of Cook Almost Anything at Least Once, who has assumed the leadership of this long-running event from its creator, Kalyn Denny of Kalyn's Kitchen.~~~Been There, Done That~Pasta with Olives, Parsley and Caper SaucePasta with Smoked SalmonKasha Varnishkes with Frizzled OnionsOther People's Eats ~Spaghetti Squash PuttanescaCauliflower PuttanescaPasta alla Puttanesca",

Add the celery, carrot, and onion; cook until very soft, 8 to 10 minutes.                                                                3.Add the tomato paste and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Add the thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns, anchovies, and garlic; cook 3 minutes.                                                                4.Add the wines, vinegar, and sugar; raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and add the broths. Leave over medium heat while you brown the lamb shanks.                                                                5.Pour the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil into a sauté pan. Over medium-high heat, brown the lamb shanks well on all sides, using tongs to flip them over.                                                                6.Transfer lamb shanks to a roasting pan and pour the braising liquid on top. Cover with aluminum foil and cook in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove the foil and cook 2 1/2 to 3 hours more, turning the shanks over every half hour until the meat is very soft.                                                                7.Remove the shanks from the braising liquid and strain the liquid. Skim any fat that rises to the surface, then use the liquid as a sauce. Serve in shallow bowls atop White Bean Puree.

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "No one wine will suit every pasta dish. Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish."

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Ruffino Il Ducale Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle."

With a sharp knife, slicing thinly across the grain, cut 8 equal slices, each about 1 ounce. Lightly oil two sheets of parchment or wax paper (we use the 9-inch parchment circles sold in pastry supply shops). Place 2 slices of beef side by side on one of the oiled sheets. Lay the second sheet, oiled side down, over the beef. With a heavy mallet, pound down and toward you, letting the weight of the mallet flatten the meat. Rotate the parchment and continue pounding gently. As the meat gets thinner, use lighter strokes to avoid tearing or pounding too thin. Flatten enough to form a 9-inch circle. Hold the package up to the light to make sure the meat is uniformly thin.                                                    Repeat to make the remaining 3 portions. Cover and refrigerate while preparing the garnish ingredients.                                                    To serve, remove the top sheets of paper from the pounded meat. Invert the carpaccio portions onto four chilled 9-inch plates, and carefully peel back the remaining paper sheets. Lightly season each portion with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cut the anchovy fillets in half lengthwise and arrange 4 or 5 pieces randomly over the meat. Sprinkle with the capers and parsley. Use a vegetable peeler to shave large curls of Parmesan cheese over each serving. Finish with a good drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Serve with lemon wedges.                                                    Other garnish options: Omit the Parmesan, and sauce with strong Dijon mustard, either plain or thinned with crme frache. A little finely diced shallot, macerated briefly in lemon juice or vinegar, adds a nice spark and refreshing crunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                var articleType_27_data = {};                    articleType_27_data.init_step_by_step_images = 0;",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Seabass works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Scarpetta Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Preheat oven to 450. Using a small sharp knife, cut off all peel and white pith from fruit. Working over a medium bowl, cut between membranes to release segments into bowl. Squeeze in juices from membranes; discard membranes. Drain fruit, reserving 1/2 cup juices. Return segments and juices to bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Pat fish dry. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large heavy ovenproof skillet over high heat. Add grapeseed oil. Add fish; cook without moving, occasionally pressing fish gently with a spatula to keep all of surface in contact with pan, until fish is golden brown and releases easily from pan, 45 minutes. Turn fish, transfer to oven, and roast until just opaque in the center, 35 minutes. Place fruit and avocado on plates.  Top with fillets. Spoon 2 Tbsp. citrus juices over fruit on each plate. Drizzle 1 Tbsp. avocado oil over fish and fruit.",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Archery Summit Vireton Pinot Gris with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "For first step in this recipe is to set up your outdoor grill, a hibachi or kettle grill with do just fine. Use natural hardwood charcoal. Start the fire with kindling and paper; light it with only matches-not lighter fluid. Lighter fluid will give the food an unnatural chemical taste. Get the charcoal to a medium heat and set the grill rack about 4 inches above the coals.                          Make a few slits into the sides of the fish and insert the garlic slices into the incisions. Rub the fish with salt and oil. Grill for about 8 minutes per side. After turning the fish, rub olive oil and salt onto the spring onions and grill with the fish for the remaining 8 minutes. Remove fish and onions from the grill and onto a warm plate.                          For the relish simply mix all of the ingredients together and scoop onto the hot fish (can be made a day inn advance).",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Seabass can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Alois Lageder Terran Alpina Pinot Grigio Vigneti delle Dolomiti. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Preparation                                                    Make crab salad:                Blanch sea bean tips in a small saucepan of boiling salted water 30 seconds, then drain in a sieve and pat dry.                                                                            Reserve 1/4 cup sea bean tips for garnish, then stir together remaining tips with crab and scallions. Stir together lime juice and curry powder in a small bowl, then pour over crab and toss well. Add salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine.                                                                        Prepare and cook fish:                Cut 1 sea bass fillet in half crosswise (each piece should measure about 4 by 3 inches). Season skinned sides of both halves lightly with salt, then stack pieces, skinned sides together, to form a \"steak.\" Brush top generously with egg white and top evenly with about 2 tablespoons pistachios, pressing to adhere. Assemble 5 more servings in same manner.                                                                            Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.                                                                            Fold 1 sheet of parchment in half crosswise and, starting at 1 end of crease, cut out a half heart shape, keeping vertical crease as long as possible. Unfold heart and arrange on a work surface with point nearest you, then place a fish steak just to 1 side of crease. Fold other half of heart over fish to enclose and, starting at top of crease, turn in edges of parchment in overlapping folds, about 1 inch apart, pressing each fold firmly as you go, to form a tight seal. Tuck last fold under packet and secure with a paper clip. Make 5 more packets in same manner.                                                                            Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sear 2 fish packets, starting with nut sides down, until nuts are pale golden, about 30 seconds (watch closely, as nuts burn easily). Carefully turn packets over with a slotted metal spatula and sear until fish is golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer seared packets, nut sides up, with spatula to baking sheet. Sear remaining packets in same manner, adding more oil to skillet as needed.                                                                            Bake packets until fish is just cooked through, about 13 minutes.                                                                            While fish bakes, divide crab salad among 6 plates, arranging in center as a bed for fish.                                                                            Cut open each packet and lightly brush top (nut side) with 1 teaspoon pistachio oil, then sprinkle with fleur de sel. Carefully transfer fish with spatula to crab salad, discarding parchment, and pour coconut sauce around fish. Sprinkle each with reserved sea bean tips.                                                Cooks' note:            ·Fish packets can be assembled 3 hours ahead and chilled. Let stand at room temperature 45 minutes before cooking.",

DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring pesto to room temperature and stir before using.                                    For fish:                                        Combine olive oil, mint, and thyme in small bowl. Spread herb mixture all over both sides of fish fillets. Cover and refrigerate fish at least 3 hours and up to 5 hours.                                    For spiced carrots:                                        Stir all seeds in small dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes.

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Seabass. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle."

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Fish can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 26 dollars."

  "instructions": "PreparationMarinate vegetables:                                        Core tomato and cut a shallow X in bottom, then blanch in boiling water 10 seconds. Transfer with a slotted spoon to an ice bath to stop cooking. Keep water at a boil.                                                                            Lift out tomato (reserve ice bath), then peel, seed, and dice. Put in a bowl with garlic, basil, thyme, olives, and capers.                                                                            Blanch celery, fennel, and zucchini in boiling water 30 seconds, then drain and transfer to ice bath. When vegetables are chilled, drain and stir into tomato mixture.                                                                            Cook bell peppers and onion in 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature, then stir into vegetables along with saffron and enough remaining oil to cover (about 2 cups). Marinate, covered and chilled, 24 hours.                                    Prepare fish:                                        Preheat oven to 450F with rack in middle.                                                                            Put fish, skin side up, in a shallow baking pan and pat dry. Sprinkle with sea salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then drizzle with a little oil. Roast fish until just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes.                                                                            Meanwhile, gently warm half of vegetable mixture and stir in lemon. Serve fish topped with vegetables and sprinkled with chives and coarse sea salt.                                    Cooks' note:Leftover vegetables can be chilled up to 3 days and served over pasta or salad or with eggs.",

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 99 dollars."

  "instructions": "To prepare vinaigrette: Peel the garlic and smash with the side of a chefs knife. Using a fork, mash the garlic with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl to form a coarse paste. Whisk in 5 tablespoons oil. Add 6 tablespoons orange juice, vinegar and mustard; whisk until well blended. Taste and whisk in up to 4 tablespoons more juice to mellow the flavor; season with more salt, if desired. Set aside at room temperature.To prepare salad: Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a large saucepan fitted with a steamer basket. Add potatoes; cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, slice and place in a shallow bowl. Drizzle with 1/3 cup vinaigrette; set aside.Add beans to the steamer basket; cook until bright green and just tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Rinse in a colander with cold water until cool. Drain well. Place in a medium bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons vinaigrette.Combine lemon juice, 2 tablespoons oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a sturdy sealable plastic bag; shake until the salt dissolves. Add fish and marinate for up to 20 minutes while you ready the grill.Preheat grill to medium-high for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to medium. (For a charcoal grill, wait until the flames subside and only coals and some ash remainflames will cause the oil on the fish to burn.)Drain the fish and pat dry with paper towels. Season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Oil the grill rack (see Tip). Grill the fish, turning once, until browned and just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side for halibut; 3 to 4 minutes per side for bass.Arrange lettuce leaves on a large serving platter. Arrange the fish (whole or flaked into large chunks), potatoes, green beans and tomatoes on top. Drizzle with the remaining vinaigrette. Garnish with eggs, olives, parsley and pepper to taste.",

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Maison Noir OPP Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 25 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Directions            Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes, onion, 1 of the poblanos, and  teaspoon salt. Cover and cook, stirring often, until the potatoes begin to soften, 12 to 14 minutes (reduce heat to medium if the skillet becomes too brown).Add the broth, tomatoes, oregano, and the remaining poblano to the skillet and cook for 1 minute, scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Season the fish with  teaspoon each salt and black pepper and place on top of the vegetables. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender and the fish is opaque throughout, 8 to 12 minutes more. Sprinkle with additional oregano.",

  "instructions": "Begin by making galette dough. Whisk egg yolk and vinegar together in a small cup or bowl and add ice water. In a food processor, pulse flour, salt and butter until a course, crumbly meal forms. Add liquid and quickly run processor just until a ball of dough forms. Immediately stop processor, remove dough and flatten into a disk. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or until ready to use.                          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Put rockfish on a lightly greased sheet pan and season with lemon zest, lemon juice, salt and crab boil seasoning, to taste. Roast until fish is firm to the touch and flakes easily, about 15 to 20 minutes depending on thickness of fillets. Set aside.                          Remove galette dough from refrigerator, lightly dust with flour and roll out to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Using a 1 1/2 to 2\" cookie cutter, or a lightly floured glass, cut dough into circles and put on a lightly greased baking sheet. Score each circle with the tines of a fork and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown. If the galettes are puffing up too much, put a second, ungreased cookie sheet on top of the first to weight the dough down slightly.                          Remove galettes from oven and top with warm flaked rockfish, truffle oil and chives (if using). Serve immediately.",

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle."
  },
  "instructions": "Preheat a grill to high. Toast the coriander seeds in a dry skillet over medium-high heat, tossing, about 3 minutes. Crush the seeds on a cutting board (the bottom of a measuring cup works well), then pulse with the parsley, cilantro, ginger, vegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon water in a food processor to make a coarse mixture. Toss the corn and tomatoes with 2 teaspoons of the herb mixture in a bowl and season with salt. Tear off four large sheets (about 16 inches long) of heavy-duty foil. Place one piece of fish in the center of each. (If the ends of the fillets are thin, tuck them under.) Top with a spoonful of the remaining herb mixture and surround with the corn-tomato relish. Fold up the ends of the foil and seal into packets, leaving room inside for heat circulation. Grill the packets, covered, until the fish is just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully open the packets and slide the fish and vegetables onto plates. Top with more cilantro and serve with lime.                          Photograph by Antonis Achilleos",

    "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars."

  "instructions": "Preparation                                                        Whisk together zest, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste, then add olive oil in a stream, whisking until combined well. Whisk in olives and chopped oregano.                                                                Make 1-inch-long slits at 2-inch intervals down middle of fish on both sides with a sharp paring knife, then brush fish all over with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper. Season fish cavity with salt and pepper, then evenly distribute 3 lemon rounds and 3 oregano sprigs in cavity. Close cavity, then evenly arrange remaining 3 lemon rounds and 3 oregano sprigs on top of fish and tie fish closed with string at 2-inch intervals, securing lemon slices and oregano sprigs to fish.                                                                Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderate.                                                                Grill fish on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using gas grill, 15 minutes. Turn fish over using a metal spatula and tongs, then grill until just cooked through, about 15 minutes more.                                                                Transfer fish to a large platter using 2 metal spatulas, then cut and discard string. Serve fish with sauce.                                                Cooks' notes:            • If you aren't able to grill outdoors, whole fish can be roasted on an oiled large baking sheet (17 by 14 inches) in middle of a preheated 425°F oven, without turning, until just cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. If fish extends beyond baking sheet, fold up two 12-inch-long pieces of foil and put under head and tail to extend baking surface.• If fish tail begins to brown too much (on grill or in oven), loosely wrap with a small sheet of foil.",

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Alois Lageder Terran Alpina Pinot Grigio Vigneti delle Dolomiti. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Preparation                                        1. Season the fillets with the salt and pepper and dredge them in the flour. Shake off any excess flour. Put half of the oil in a large saut pan over high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, saut the fish on one side for 3 minutes. Then flip and cook on the other side until just done, 1 to 2 minutes; the fillets should be golden brown and just cooked through. Transfer them to a platter and keep them warm in a 200F oven while you make the sauce.                                                                            2. Add the remaining oil and the butter to a saut pan and cook over high heat until the butter starts to foam. Add the shallot. Cook until it is golden and the butter is a pale hazelnut brown, about 1 minute. Add the orange juice and cook for 1 minute more. Add the lemon juice. When the butter mixture starts to foam again, remove the pan from heat. Season with more salt and pepper, if desired.                                                                            3. Put a piece of sole on each plate, drizzle with the brown butter, and serve immediately.                                    Tip:Invest in a fish spatula. Longer and wider than a regular spatula, it's the tool you'll need to prevent fish from breaking when you turn or lift it in the pan.",

  "instructions": "Mix 3 tablespoons butter, the lemon zest, juice, shallots and 2 tablespoons chives until well combined. Place the butter onto a small piece of plastic wrap and, using both ends of the plastic wrap, spin it around to make a cylinder. Chill for at least 30 minutes.                          Using needle nose tweezers, remove all the bones from the trout. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over moderate heat in a large nonstick skillet. Sprinkle the trout with salt and pepper. Place the fish skin-side down and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook for another 3 minutes. Using a sharp paring knife, slide the knife into the thickest part of the fish.

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Felsinan I Sistri Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough cold water to cover them by 2 inches. Add 2 teaspoons of the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until almost fork-tender, about 15 minutes. Add the green beans and cook 5 minutes more, until just tender. Drain and set aside. In the same pot, melt the butter over low heat with the chives, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper. Quarter the potatoes and return them to the pot with the green beans. Stir gently to combine. Season the fish with the remaining salt and pepper and place in a large skillet. Pour in just enough wine to reach halfway up the sides of the fish. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook 6 to 8 minutes, covered, until the fish is opaque. Serve with the beans and potatoes. Spoon any extra chive butter on top of the fish.Tip: You can replace the halibut with any firm-fleshed white fish, like swordfish. The fillets should be 1 inch thick.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Alois Lageder Terran Alpina Pinot Grigio Vigneti delle Dolomiti. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle."

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Halibut. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 99 dollars per bottle."
  },
  "instructions": "In a medium bowl, toss the parsley with the chopped tarragon and lemon zest. Rub the herbs all over the halibut; cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.                                                                                                In a large saucepan, cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Salt generously and simmer over moderately high heat until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and let cool to room temperature.                                                                                                Light a grill. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the 1/4 cup of olive oil. Add the garlic and shallots and cook over moderately high heat until golden, about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook over low heat, smashing them gently with a spatula, until they start to break apart. Continue cooking, stirring a few times, until the potatoes are browned and crisp, about 5 minutes total. Season with salt and pepper.                                                                                                In a medium skillet, melt the butter. Add the whole tarragon leaves and cook over moderate heat until the tarragon is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes burst and the butter is browned, about 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.                                                                                                Drizzle the halibut with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the fillets over moderately high heat until nicely charred and just cooked, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the fish to plates and spoon the tomato butter on top. Serve immediately with the smashed potatoes.",

  },
  "instructions": "Prepare the sauce:1 Put the first six sauce ingredients (clam juice, sherry, whole milk, garlic, shallots, bay leaf) in a pot and bring to a boil. Boil it down by half.2 In a separate saucepan (1-qt minimum) prepare the roux. Heat one tablespoon of butter in the saucepan on medium heat until it is foamy. Sprinkle in the flour, stirring a couple of minutes with a metal whisk until well mixed (tan, but not brown).3 Slowly add the reduced mixture to the roux, stirring quickly to incorporate. When you first add some of the mixture, the roux will bubble up. Just keep adding the mixture and keep whisking to incorporate.4 Turn the heat to low. Slowly whisk in the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time. Add lemon juice, salt, and white pepper. Add some more clam stock or water if the sauce is too thick. Add the chopped parsley right before you serve.Prepare the fish:1 Arrange an oven rack so that when the fish is on a baking pan in the oven it will be 4 to 5 inches from the heat. Preheat the oven to 350F.2 Rinse the fish in cold water, cut into serving pieces if necessary. Remove any bones with fish-bone tweezers or (spotless clean) pliers. Lay the fish flat in a aluminum foil lined baking pan.Rub some olive oil over both sides of the pieces, enough to coat. Sprinkle both sides with a few shakes of salt and pepper.Bake for 10-15 minutes, until just done.To test, use the tip of a knife to gently cut into the thickest part of the fillet. The fish is done when the fish has just turned from translucent to opaque at the center. Once you pull the fish out of the oven it will continue to cook for a few minutes.3 Serve the fish with the sauce poured on top. Rice, crusty bread and a simple salad are good accompaniments.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars."

Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Michael Pozzan Russian River Valley Chardonnay. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars."

  "instructions": "In a 6- to 8-inch frying pan over high heat, boil garlic and shallot in vermouth until mixture is reduced by about half, 5 to 8 minutes.

Boil, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and is reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, about 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Lay fillet in a buttered 12- by 17-inch baking pan. Dot the fillet with butter, drizzle with wine, and sprinkle with tarragon. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.                                                                                                 Bake in a 400 oven until salmon is barely opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 13 to 18 minutes. Slide salmon onto a platter.                                                                                                 If sauce is cool, stir over medium-high heat until hot.

    "pairingText": "Halibut on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Archery Summit Vireton Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle."
  },
  "instructions": "Brush the halibut fillets with the olive oil to coat completely. In a small bowl, stir together the 1 Tbs. chervil, the fennel seeds, orange zest, salt and pepper. Sprinkle the mixture over the halibut fillets, distributing it evenly so that all sides are seasoned. Transfer the fillets to a shallow baking dish, cover and refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Bring to room temperature 15 minutes before grilling.To make the potato-fennel puree, in a large pot over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the fennel and saut until translucent and golden, about 15 minutes. Add the stock, potatoes and the 1 tsp. salt. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, cover and cook until the potatoes are soft when pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes.Drain the potatoes and fennel in a colander, return to the pot and immediately mash with a potato masher. Add the butter and slowly pour in the half-and-half while stirring with a wooden spoon. Add the mayonnaise and continue to stir until light and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill. Lightly oil the grill rack and position it about 6 inches from the heat source.Grill the halibut fillets, turning once, until opaque throughout, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Garnish with chervil and serve immediately with the potato-fennel puree alongside. Serves 4.Adapted from Williams-Sonoma Entertaining with the Seasons (Free Press, 2010).",

  "instructions": "In a medium bowl, stir the butter with the Corn Pops, bread crumbs, curry powder, salt and cayenne. Transfer the butter to a piece of plastic wrap and form it into a 3-inch-long cylinder. Refrigerate the Corn Pops butter until firm.                                              Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine the milk with the bay leaf and star anise. Break each ear of corn in half and add them to the saucepan. Simmer over moderately low heat until the corn is very tender, about 40 minutes. Let cool slightly, then cut the kernels from the cobs and transfer them to a blender. Discard the bay leaf and star anise and add 1/2 cup of the milk to the blender. Blend at low speed until pureed. Increase the speed to high and gradually add the remaining milk; puree until very smooth. Add the crme frache and puree until blended.                                              Preheat the oven to 250. Cut the Corn Pops butter into 4 pieces. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the grapeseed oil until shimmering. Season the halibut with salt and pepper and cook over high heat, turning once, until golden, about 6 minutes. Transfer the halibut to a baking dish and top each fillet with a slice of the Corn Pops butter. Bake in the oven for about 2 minutes, or just until the butter begins to melt.                                              Add the basil to the blender and puree with the corn soup; season with salt. Transfer the halibut fillets to shallow bowls. Pour the soup all around, garnish with basil sprigs and serve.",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Halibut. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars."
  },
  "instructions": "In a small, dry skillet over medium-low heat, toast the pepitas lightly. Don't allow them to brown. As soon as you begin to smell them, remove the pan from the heat and transfer to a large plate. Set aside.                          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.                          Sprinkle the halibut on both sides with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper. Heat the oil in a large skillet with an ovenproof handle over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer but is not smoking. Place the fillets skin side up in the hot oil and sear until the fish begins to turn color, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the fillets and add the lemon juice, wine, and butter to the pan. As soon as the butter melts and becomes foamy, add the capers and tomatoes and simmer until the tomatoes release some juices, about 1 minute.                          Place the pan in the oven until the fish is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Baste the fish with some of the juices and transfer to serving plates. Add the cup torn basil, pepitas, and the remaining teaspoon of salt to the pan juices and stir until the basil is slightly wilted. Spoon the mixture over the fish, garnish with fresh basil leaves, and serve.",

Add the potatoes and cook over low heat, smashing them gently with a spatula, until they start to break apart. Continue cooking, stirring a few times, until the potatoes are browned and crisp, about 5 minutes total. Season with salt and pepper.                                                                                                In a medium skillet, melt the butter. Add the whole tarragon leaves and cook over moderate heat until the tarragon is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes burst and the butter is browned, about 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.                                                                                                Drizzle the halibut with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 46 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Prepare the sauce:1 Put the first six sauce ingredients (clam juice, sherry, whole milk, garlic, shallots, bay leaf) in a pot and bring to a boil. Boil it down by half.2 In a separate saucepan (1-qt minimum) prepare the roux. Heat one tablespoon of butter in the saucepan on medium heat until it is foamy. Sprinkle in the flour, stirring a couple of minutes with a metal whisk until well mixed (tan, but not brown).3 Slowly add the reduced mixture to the roux, stirring quickly to incorporate. When you first add some of the mixture, the roux will bubble up. Just keep adding the mixture and keep whisking to incorporate.4 Turn the heat to low. Slowly whisk in the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time. Add lemon juice, salt, and white pepper. Add some more clam stock or water if the sauce is too thick. Add the chopped parsley right before you serve.Prepare the fish:1 Arrange an oven rack so that when the fish is on a baking pan in the oven it will be 4 to 5 inches from the heat. Preheat the oven to 350F.2 Rinse the fish in cold water, cut into serving pieces if necessary. Remove any bones with fish-bone tweezers or (spotless clean) pliers. Lay the fish flat in a aluminum foil lined baking pan.Rub some olive oil over both sides of the pieces, enough to coat. Sprinkle both sides with a few shakes of salt and pepper.Bake for 10-15 minutes, until just done.To test, use the tip of a knife to gently cut into the thickest part of the fillet. The fish is done when the fish has just turned from translucent to opaque at the center. Once you pull the fish out of the oven it will continue to cook for a few minutes.3 Serve the fish with the sauce poured on top. Rice, crusty bread and a simple salad are good accompaniments.",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Salmon works really well with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Valley of the Moon Chardonnay with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "In a 6- to 8-inch frying pan over high heat, boil garlic and shallot in vermouth until mixture is reduced by about half, 5 to 8 minutes. Add broth and bring to a boil again.                                                                                                 Add cream, olives, and chopped thyme. Boil, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and is reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, about 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cover and set aside.                                                                                                 Rinse salmon fillet and pat dry. With tweezers, pull out pin bones. Lay fillet in a buttered 12- by 17-inch baking pan. Dot the fillet with butter, drizzle with wine, and sprinkle with tarragon. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.                                                                                                 Bake in a 400 oven until salmon is barely opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 13 to 18 minutes. Slide salmon onto a platter.                                                                                                 If sauce is cool, stir over medium-high heat until hot. Drizzle fish with some of the sauce; serve remaining to add to taste. Garnish fish with thyme sprigs.

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Halibut. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Archery Summit Vireton Pinot Gris with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle."
  },
  "instructions": "Brush the halibut fillets with the olive oil to coat completely. In a small bowl, stir together the 1 Tbs. chervil, the fennel seeds, orange zest, salt and pepper. Sprinkle the mixture over the halibut fillets, distributing it evenly so that all sides are seasoned. Transfer the fillets to a shallow baking dish, cover and refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Bring to room temperature 15 minutes before grilling.To make the potato-fennel puree, in a large pot over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the fennel and saut until translucent and golden, about 15 minutes. Add the stock, potatoes and the 1 tsp. salt. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, cover and cook until the potatoes are soft when pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes.Drain the potatoes and fennel in a colander, return to the pot and immediately mash with a potato masher. Add the butter and slowly pour in the half-and-half while stirring with a wooden spoon. Add the mayonnaise and continue to stir until light and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill. Lightly oil the grill rack and position it about 6 inches from the heat source.Grill the halibut fillets, turning once, until opaque throughout, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Garnish with chervil and serve immediately with the potato-fennel puree alongside. Serves 4.Adapted from Williams-Sonoma Entertaining with the Seasons (Free Press, 2010).",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Halibut can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle."
  },
  "instructions": "In a medium bowl, stir the butter with the Corn Pops, bread crumbs, curry powder, salt and cayenne. Transfer the butter to a piece of plastic wrap and form it into a 3-inch-long cylinder. Refrigerate the Corn Pops butter until firm.                                              Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine the milk with the bay leaf and star anise. Break each ear of corn in half and add them to the saucepan. Simmer over moderately low heat until the corn is very tender, about 40 minutes. Let cool slightly, then cut the kernels from the cobs and transfer them to a blender. Discard the bay leaf and star anise and add 1/2 cup of the milk to the blender. Blend at low speed until pureed. Increase the speed to high and gradually add the remaining milk; puree until very smooth. Add the crme frache and puree until blended.                                              Preheat the oven to 250. Cut the Corn Pops butter into 4 pieces. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the grapeseed oil until shimmering. Season the halibut with salt and pepper and cook over high heat, turning once, until golden, about 6 minutes. Transfer the halibut to a baking dish and top each fillet with a slice of the Corn Pops butter. Bake in the oven for about 2 minutes, or just until the butter begins to melt.                                              Add the basil to the blender and puree with the corn soup; season with salt. Transfer the halibut fillets to shallow bowls. Pour the soup all around, garnish with basil sprigs and serve.",

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Halibut. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Alois Lageder Terran Alpina Pinot Grigio Vigneti delle Dolomiti with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle."
  },
  "instructions": "In a small, dry skillet over medium-low heat, toast the pepitas lightly. Don't allow them to brown. As soon as you begin to smell them, remove the pan from the heat and transfer to a large plate. Set aside.                          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.                          Sprinkle the halibut on both sides with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper. Heat the oil in a large skillet with an ovenproof handle over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer but is not smoking. Place the fillets skin side up in the hot oil and sear until the fish begins to turn color, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the fillets and add the lemon juice, wine, and butter to the pan. As soon as the butter melts and becomes foamy, add the capers and tomatoes and simmer until the tomatoes release some juices, about 1 minute.                          Place the pan in the oven until the fish is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Baste the fish with some of the juices and transfer to serving plates. Add the cup torn basil, pepitas, and the remaining teaspoon of salt to the pan juices and stir until the basil is slightly wilted. Spoon the mixture over the fish, garnish with fresh basil leaves, and serve.",

    "pairingText": "Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Foley Estate Winery Sta. Rita Hills Chardonnay with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Preparation                                        Season each piece of salmon with salt and pepper and sprinkle with a little chopped parsley. If sauting, heat the olive oil in a wide skillet and cook the fish, about 3 minutes on the first side, then about 2 minutes on the second side to achieve a medium-rare temperature. (Increase the cooking time by about 90 seconds on each side if you want the salmon to be cooked through.) You may also grill or broil the salmon, as desired.                                                                            Spoon the Martini Sauce over (or alongside) the cooked salmon and serve immediately. This salmon is delicious with boiled new potatoes or rice.                                    Martini Sauce                                        Place the shallots, gin, vermouth, juniper berries, and green peppercorns in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until reduced to about 3 tablespoons liquid. Add the cream and reduce to 1/4 cup.                                                                            Strain and return the liquid to the saucepan (discard the solids). Whisk in the butter. Add the olives and season to taste with lemon juice, salt, and a little pepper. Cover and keep warm while you prepare the salmon.

    "pairingText": "Haddock works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle."

    "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 46 dollars per bottle."

    "pairingText": "Fish on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Luna Vineyards Napa Valley Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle."

    "pairingText": "Tilapia can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Luna Vineyards Napa Valley Pinot Grigio. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars."

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish."

Transfer to a bowl and stir in tarragon.                                                                Lightly brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with melted butter and heat over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Ladle about 1/4 cup batter into skillet, tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom, then pour excess batter back into bowl. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly for next crespella.) Cook until just set and underside is lightly browned, about 30 seconds, then invert crespella onto a clean kitchen towel in one layer to cool. (It will be cooked on one side only.) Make 5 more crespelle with remaining batter in same manner, brushing skillet with butter as needed and transferring to towel as cooked, arranging them in one layer.                                                            Make sauce:                Heat butter in a 1- to 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat until foam subsides. Add flour and cook, whisking, 2 minutes. Add clam juice and water in a slow stream, whisking, then bring to a boil, whisking. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in cream, zest, and pepper, then remove from heat.                                                            Assemble cannelloni:                Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F. Butter a 13- by 9-inch or other 3-quart glass or ceramic baking dish and spread half of sauce in dish.

Put 1 crespella, pale side down, on a work surface, then place 1 salmon fillet, buttered side down, in center of crespella and fold crespella around salmon, leaving ends open. Transfer to baking dish, arranging, seam side down, in sauce. Make 5 more cannelloni with remaining salmon and crespelle in same manner, arranging in baking dish. Spoon remaining sauce over cannelloni.                                                                Bake until salmon is just cooked through and sauce is bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes.",

Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle."

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Fish on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 99 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "In a bowl, combine the pepper, paprika, thyme, mustard, salt, and cayenne. Brush both sides of the fish with 2 tsp. of the oil and gently rub the spice mix all over the fish.    In a small skillet, heat the butter over medium heat, swirling the skillet, until the butter is a deep amber brown, about 3 minutes; watch carefully so it doesnt burn. Whisk in the lemon juice and keep warm.    Set a heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and heat 1 Tbs. of the oil. When the oil is hot, add two of the fillets and sear until cooked through, about 2 minutes. per side; transfer to a plate and tent with foil. Wipe out the pan and repeat with the remaining oil and fish. Serve immediately, spooning the butter over the fish.

    "pairingText": "Salmon on the menu? Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Chamisal Vineyards Monterey Chardonnay. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars."

  "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 425. In a medium roasting pan, toss the fennel with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast the fennel for 30 minutes, turning halfway through, or until tender and browned.                                              Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring the Pernod to a boil. Add the cream and star anise and simmer over moderate heat until reduced to  3/4 cup, about 8 minutes. Strain the cream and season with salt and pepper.                                              Light a grill. In a small skillet, melt the butter. Add the shallot and garlic and cook over moderate heat until softened, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Stir in the lemon and orange zests, bread crumbs and parsley and let cool.                                              Spread open the salmon fillets, season them with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the parsley mixture. Starting at the thinner end, roll each fillet into a log. Tie each log at each end with kitchen string, then cut each log into 2 equal pieces; you should have 4 rolls secured with kitchen string.                                              Season the salmon rolls with salt and pepper and grill over a medium-hot fire for 6 minutes, turning once. Move the salmon rolls to indirect heat and continue grilling until just barely cooked through, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and carefully remove the strings. Rewarm the fennel and the Pernod cream sauce.                                              Spoon the Creole Mustard Spaetzle onto 4 large plates. Set the salmon on the spaetzle, arrange the fennel wedges around it and spoon the sauce around the fish. Serve right away.",

  "instructions": "Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper. Drizzle them lightly with olive oil, rub them with the sage and thyme, and spread with the lemon zest. Lay a sage leaf and a sprig of thyme on each fillet. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to an hour.    Heat the oven to 400F. In a wide, heavy saut pan, heat the butter and olive oil until very hot. Add the diced leeks, stir to coat well, and reduce the heat to medium low. Salt them lightly, stir again, and continue to cook slowly until the leeks are soft, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a few tablespoons of water if the pan gets too dry or the leeks are browning too much. Add the garlic, chopped herbs, salt, and pepper and cook for a few minutes until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Spread the leeks in the bottom of a 2-1/2-qt. ovenproof baking dish. Lay the fish fillets on top and bake until a paring knife inserted in the fish feels warm when touched to your lip, about 20 minutes. To serve, spoon the herbed leeks over each fillet.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      with 1 tsp. oil for drizzling, Calories                        (kcal):                      410, Fat                        (kcal):                      25, Fat Calories                        (g):                      220, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      5, Protein                        (g):                      34, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      13, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      11, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      5, Sodium                        (g):                      990, Cholesterol                        (g):                      100, Fiber                        (g):                      2,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews",

    "pairingText": "Chardonnay, Muscadet, and Riesling are my top picks for Clams. Buttery chardonnay is great for scallops, shrimp, crab, and lobster, while muscadet is a classic pick for mussels, oysters, and clams. If you've got some spice in your shellfish, a semi-dry riesling can balance out the heat. You could try Michael Pozzan Russian River Valley Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Bring broth, lemon, garlic, thyme, bay leaf, and 1/2 tsp. pepper to a boil in a large pot. Reduce heat and add escarole and clams. Cover pot; simmer until clams open, about 15 minutes.                                                                                                 Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add pancetta and cook until crisp, about 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to a paper towel.                                                                                                 Sprinkle fish with salt and remaining 1/2 tsp. pepper. Lay fish in pan and cook over medium heat until bottom edge looks browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add butter, then turn fish over and cook until opaque in center, about 3 minutes.                                                                                                 Spoon escarole and clams into 4 serving bowls, pouring in just enough broth to cover. Top each with a fish fillet, a few pieces of fried pancetta, and a few parsley leaves.

    "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Chloe Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars."

  "instructions": "Using tongs dip each banana leaf one by one into boiling water, remove immediately, rinse under cold water, dry thoroughly, leaves should be soft and pliable.Cut each fish 3 times, place each fish on a leaf, top each fish with lemon grass and garlic.Combine garlic, juice, sauces and oil, drizzle a little sauce over each fish reserving about 3-4 tablespoons for the vegeatbles.Fold leaves over fish and secure with kitchen string. Place parcels in a pre-heated oven of 180 degress celsius and cook for 25-30 min's or until cooked through.Alternativley which I love banana leaves for, cook on the BBQ, covered, using indirect heat for about 20-25 Min's. (I find it takes me 30 Min's in my oven and about 20 Min's on the BBQ, but I do have an extremely hot BBQ, I do not know how 4 smaller fish fillets affects the time as I have only cooked 2 larger fish.).The banana leaves will get quite crispy and may even burn in places, they will stay quite moist underneath as the juices run from fish and sauce. For presentation purposes I keep 2 banana leaves to use as the base to serve fish on after.Vegetables.Heat olive oil in a wok or large pan, add garlic and ginger and stir fry until fragrant.Add pepper, carrot and sesame oil, stir fry 2-3 Minutes, add both cabbages, peas, sprouts and reserved sauce. Stir fry until vegetables are just tender serve immediately with fish.Extra sauce.Just an optional extra if you prefer to have a little more sauce to drizzle over fish once served.Combine the 3 ingredients in a small microwave safe bowl and microwave 30-45 seconds to just warm through.To Serve: I place a banana leaf on a serving platter top with whole fish, I pour remaining juice and sauce from the bananan leaf fish was cooked in over fish, and arrange the vegetables around the fish, garnish with sliced onions.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Ruffino Il Ducale Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle."

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The FitVine Wine Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

  "instructions": "Break star anise into small pieces. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, stir star anise or anise seeds, cumin, and coriander until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour spices into a blender and whirl until finely ground, or pour into a mortar and grind with a pestle.                                                                                                 Add coconut milk to frying pan; stir often over medium-high heat until milk is bubbly and fat begins to separate, 2 to 6 minutes (reduce heat if milk splatters out of pan). Add all the curry paste and stir until aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 1/4 cups broth, ground spices, whole basil leaves, fish sauce, and sugar. Rinse kaffir lime leaves, tear each in half, and stir into sauce; set aside.                                                                                                 Rinse fish and pat dry; cut into eight equal pieces and arrange in a 12- by 16-inch baking pan. Drizzle oil over fish and turn pieces to coat; set slightly apart.                                                                                                 Bake in a 400 regular or convection oven until fish is barely opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 10 to 15 minutes for halibut, 8 to 10 minutes for catfish.                                                                                                 Meanwhile, in a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring 2 1/2 to 3 quarts water to a boil. Add beans and cook until almost tender to bite, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in bell pepper, then drain immediately.                                                                                                 Just before fish is done, stir green curry sauce over high heat until hot again. In a small bowl, mix remaining 1/2 cup broth with 2 teaspoons cornstarch. Add to hot curry sauce and stir until it boils and thickens, about 1 minute. If desired, remove kaffir lime leaves.                                                                                                 Mound hot rice on eight dinner plates. Lay fish on top and scatter beans and pepper strips around fish. Spoon curry sauce over and around fish. Sprinkle slivered basil over the top. Or serve fish, sauce, and vegetables on a large platter, with rice in a bowl alongside. Add salt and pepper to taste.",

    "pairingText": "Catfish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Scarpetta Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "* I like to serve this fish in individual small baking dishes. You can also use a large baking dish in stead, though. Your call.Nothing beats fresh codfish. Ill take fresh cod over steak anytime! Mine was huge; about 15oz. Ive cut it in three equal parts. Normally Id buy 3 smaller ones in stead.Place each cod in a small baking dish and season them with a generous amount of salt and pepper.Im using3 Roma tomatoes for this. Not entirely sure where the third one went off to.Slice the tomatoes and place them on top of the cod.Combine 5 slightly heaping tbsp sour cream with 2 slightly heaping tsp coarse mustard. If youre a high-carber, feel free to use a low fat cream version in stead.Cheddar. Oh boy, whats not to love about it? I only wish it wasnt so ridiculously expensive here. Ive grated about 5oz. If youre pressed for time, just grab something like Kraft sharp cheddar. They dont sell that here, but Im sure it works like a charm.Add the cheddar to the sour cream, andspoon an equal amount of the mix on top of each cod.Bake them in a preheated oven at 400F (200C) for 25 minutes. This does depend on the thickness of your cod fillets, so keep an eye on them! They are great! Juicy fish, with slightly roasted tomatoes in a creamy, golden cheddar bath with a slight mustard twist. These are so good with a broccoli dish on the side!Because life just aint easy without pringles.For my low-carber friends, with lots of love!KayPrintableRecipe kayotic.comClick hereto print recipes older than 2010e-mail this post to a friend",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Cod. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars."
  },
  "instructions": "1 Salt cod typically comes either in dry fillets, already boned and skinned, or it comes whole. The fillets need to be rinsed, then soaked in water, and kept chilled, for 24 hours, with one or two changings of the water. If you are using a whole fish, not prepared fillets, it needs to be soaked in water for up to 48 hours, also with several changings of water, and the bones and the skin removed and discarded after soaking.2 Put salt cod in a saucepan. Add enough milk, water, or a mixture of milk and water to just cover. Bring mixture to a simmer. Let simmer for a couple minutes. Remove the fish and set aside.3 Parboil the potatoes for 20 minutes (you can cook them in the water you used to cook the fish if you want). Slice potatoes into 1/4-inch thick rounds.  4 In a large pyrex casserole or Dutch oven (use Dutch oven if making on stove-top), generously coat the bottom of the pan with olive oil. Place a layer of onion rings over the bottom of the pan. Place a layer of sliced potatoes over the onions. Breaking up the salt cod with your fingers, place pieces of salt cod in a layer over the potatoes. Taste the fish for saltiness. After a day of soaking and further cooking, there should be just a hint of saltiness in the fish. If most of the salt was soaked out of the fish, and the fish doesn't taste at all salty, you may need to sprinkle some salt back on to the fish as you place the layers down.Generously pour some olive oil over the fish. Sprinkle with freshly grated black pepper.Repeat with another layer of onions, potatoes, fish, olive oil, pepper (and more salt if needed). Then finish with layers of onions, potatoes, more olive oil, sliced hard boiled eggs, and olives.5 Place on stove top on medium heat, and cook, covered, for 30 minutes. Or heat an oven to 350F and cook, covered, for 30-40 minutes, or until everything is completely through.Serve with sides of rice and salad.",

  "instructions": "Heat a large, deep skillet over medium high heat and preheat oven to 425 degrees F.                          Cut tops off the fennel bulb. Reserve a few tablespoons of fronds (lacy dill-like greens) and chop. Quarter the bulb, then cut into each quarter on an angle to remove the core. Thinly slice the fennel.                          Add extra-virgin olive oil, fennel and onion to the pan and saute them, stirring frequently, 5 minutes. Season with salt. Add wine and reduce by half. Add potatoes to the pan in thin layers, completely covering the fennel and onions, working all the way to the edges of the pan. Pour the stock evenly over the pan. Season fish with salt and pepper. Arrange the fish on the potatoes. Bring the liquids to a bubble. Cover the pan and transfer to oven. Bake fish 15 minutes, until opaque, then uncover and bake for 2 or 3 minutes more. Transfer fish and vegetables to shallow bowls or dinner plates and garnish with parsley and fronds. Spoon juices down over the food. Serve with crusty bread for dipping.",

  "instructions": "In a small bowl, mix the 2 tsp. cornstarch with the 2 Tbs. vinegar. Add the broth, soy sauce, and ketchup. Season the fish with 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. black pepper. Spread the remaining 1/2 cup of the cornstarch on a plate, and put the eggs in a wide bowl. Dredge the fish in the cornstarch. Heat 2 Tbs. of the oil in a 12-inch nonstick pan over medium-high heat until shimmering hot. Soak the fish in the egg for a couple of seconds, then add to the pan. Cook, flipping after 3 min., until the fish is browned and a little firm to the touch, about 5 minutes total (it should not be cooked all the way through). Transfer the fish to a large plate.    Add the remaining 1 Tbs. oil to the pan, then add the chiles, white parts of the scallions, and ginger. Cook, stirring, until the scallions become translucent and browned in places, about 2 min. Give the cornstarch mixture a quick stir and then pour it into the pan. It should come to a boil and thicken quickly. Reduce the heat to medium-low, return the fish to the pan, and flip it a couple of times to coat it in the sauce. Cover the pan, leaving the lid slightly ajar, and cook until the fish is just cooked through and starting to flake, 3 to 5 min. Taste the sauce for salt and vinegar and add more to taste. Serve immediately with the sauce spooned over the fish and sprinkled with scallion greens.

    "pairingText": "Cod works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Scarpetta Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars."

  "instructions": "In a 14 to 16-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons olive oil until almost smoking. Add the onions and garlic and saute 3 to 5 minutes, until soft and light golden brown. Add the tomatoes and the chili flakes and flatten tomatoes with a fork, allowing them to release their juices. Cook for 10 minutes, until tomatoes have completely fallen apart. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Add the cod, mussels, and cockles, reduce heat to a simmer and cover, allowing to cook for 10 minutes, until fish is cooked through. Remove from heat, sprinkle with parsley, drizzle with remaining olive oil, season with salt and pepper and serve.",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Cod on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "In a small bowl, mix 1 Tbs. of the ginger, the soy sauce, vinegar, 2 Tbs. water, and about a quarter of the scallions. Set the dipping sauce aside.    Rinse the cod and pat dry it with paper towels. Season both sides lightly with salt and pepper. Put the flour in a shallow bowl. Put the egg whites in a medium bowl and whisk until a thick foam forms on the surface. To the egg whites, add the garlic, chiles, and the remaining ginger and scallions and mix well.    Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Dredge each piece of cod on both sides first in the flour and then in the egg whites, using your hands to press the scallions and chiles onto the fish. Transfer to a plate.    When the oil is hot (it will bubble if you put a scallion ring in it), add the cod, spacing the pieces evenly (you may have to cook them in two batches), and raise the heat to medium high. Turn the fish over after 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the fish is firm to the touch and flakes apart easily when pierced with a fork, about another 4 minutes. Serve immediately with the dipping sauce and the lime wedges on the side.    Serving Suggestions    Serve with white rice and spinach sauted with garlic, or with soba noodles in broth.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      290, Fat                        (kcal):                      8, Fat Calories                        (g):                      80, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      1, Protein                        (g):                      38, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      4, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      16, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      3, Sodium                        (g):                      1600, Cholesterol                        (g):                      75, Fiber                        (g):                      1,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews",

Make sauce for filling:                Wash leek in a bowl of water, then lift out and drain well. Cook leek, carrot, and celery in butter in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until tender, about 7 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in milk, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Bring sauce to a boil, stirring, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes. (Sauce will be thick.) Remove pan from heat.                                                            Make crust:                Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.

    "pairingText": "Cod works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 26 dollars."

Finely chop the dill.Remove the skin and bones from the fish and chop it into 2cm cubes. Peel the prawns.In a saucepan, heat the butter and, when it has melted, put in the onion, celery, leek and garlic. Cook it over a medium heat for 15 minutes until the onion is very soft.Add the flour to the pan, thoroughly mix it in, then add the white wine and stir that in until the flour and wine have combined.Pour in 150ml of the stock and stir that in until it has become combined, then add another 150ml of the stock and stir that to combine. Finally, add the remaining stock and stir it in. Then bring the mixture up to the boil, turn down the heat slightly and simmer it until it has reduced by half (about 5-10 minutes).Add the fish, but not the prawns, turn the heat down to medium and gently cook it for 5 minutes.Add the cream and the dill, season it with salt & pepper, gently stir it (so as not to break up the fish) and then carefully tip the contents of the pan into an oven proof dish. Then put in the prawns.Cover the mixture with the mashed potato by first putting spoonfuls around the edge of the dish and then filling in the middle. Smooth the surface of the mashed potato with a knife and then lightly drag a fork across to form a ridged pattern.Put the dish on to a baking tray and into the oven for 20 minutes. If the top is not browned enough by this time, put the dish under a hot grill for 5 minutes (or until the top is brown enough).Serve.",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Ruffino Il Ducale Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.                          Boil the potato slices in salted water until they are not quite completely cooked, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. Grease a claypot or baking dish with the olive oil and place the fish in the dish.                          In a medium bowl, whisk together the 1/4 cup olive oil, garlic, thyme, lemon, salt, and pepper. Add the onion, tomatoes, olives, and potatoes. Toss gently to coat.                          Pour the vinaigrette and vegetables over the fish. Bake in oven until fish is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, brush the exposed lemon quarters with a little olive oil, and in a small grill pan, grill the quartered lemon sections just to give a hint of charred color. Serve the fish with grilled lemon wedges.",

  "instructions": "In a small bowl, crumble the saffron in  1/2 cup of the warm water and let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a very large, deep saut pan. Add the onion and garlic and cook over high heat, stirring, until lightly browned, 2 minutes. Add the fregola and chorizo and cook, stirring, until the chorizo releases some of its fat and starts to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, white wine, saffron and its soaking liquid and the remaining 6 cups of warm water to the saut pan and bring to a boil. Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, cover and cook over low heat until the fregola is very chewy and soupy, about 10 minutes.                                              Season the shrimp and red snapper with salt and pepper and add them to the pan along with the mussels and cockles, nestling them into the fregola. Bring to a boil. Cover the pan and cook over low heat until the fregola is al dente, the fish is just cooked through and the mussels and cockles have opened, about 12 minutes longer.                                              Remove the pan from the heat and let the paella stand for 5 minutes; the fregola will absorb a bit more of the liquid, but the dish should be a bit brothy. Discard any mussels and cockles that haven't opened. Sprinkle the fregola with the chopped parsley and serve right away.",

Add the cumin and mustard seeds. Let them dance around the pot for a minute or two and then add the ginger, garlic and onion. Saute until the onion is cooked through. Add the curry and garam masala powders. Dump in the can of the coconut milk. Stir everything around to combine.Now add the fish. Just toss the whole fillets in there. Stir them around in the pot, every so often, until theyre cooked through. Take 2 forks and pull the fish into flakes (just like if you were pulling apart a chicken breast or beef brisket). Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the lime juice.For the Crou-tains (Paleo Croutons)In a large saute pan, melt the coconut oil. Add the diced plantains. As always, the smaller the dice, the faster theyll cook. Let the plantains fry until theyre cooked through and have a nice crust on the outside. Shouldnt take more than 15 minutes.Just like regular croutons, the crou-tains taste better the day theyre made. Not that theyre inedible the next day, theyre just not as crispy.",

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 99 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Heat the peanut oil in a saut pan (preferably nonstick) over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, ham, ginger, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside to cool.    Meanwhile, bring a few inches of water to a boil in your steamer. (If you don't have a bamboo steamer, you can use a pot with a flat-bottom steamer insert, or you can rig your own steamer. Just cut the top and bottom from a tuna can to use as a support for the plate and find a covered pot deep and wide enough to accommodate everything.)    Put the fish on a heatproof plate that will fit in your steamer. Sprinkle the mushroom mixture on top. Drizzle with the sherry and sesame oil. Carefully put the plate in the steamer. Cover and steam until the fish is just cooked through, about 10 minutes. SeeHow to tell when fish is truly cooked.    Transfer the fish and juices to serving plates. Drizzle with the soy sauce, sprinkle with the scallions, and serve immediately.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      per appetizer serving, Calories                        (kcal):                      160, Fat                        (kcal):                      8, Fat Calories                        (g):                      70, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      1, Protein                        (g):                      18, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      3, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      3, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      3, Sodium                        (g):                      500, Cholesterol                        (g):                      40, Fiber                        (g):                      0,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews",

  "instructions": "Cut the fish fillets into chunks that are roughly 2 inches long and 1 inch wide.Make Tori's Crunchy Panko Coating. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the beer or seltzer, flour, cornstarch, salt, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. Note that the beer will be difficult to measure out due to foam; youll need at least 1 1/2 cups of beer to make this batter. The batter should be thick like pancake batter, but if it appears clumpy or overly thick add more beer, seltzer or water until mixture is thin enough for dipping. Pour the panko breadcrumbs into another bowl. Have an empty plate handy for the breaded fish.Dip each piece of fish into the batter. When you pull the fish out of the batter, let the excess batter run back into the bowl. After dipping in the batter, gently roll each piece in panko crumbs to coat. Leaving too much batter on the fish will lead to clumping, so make sure your fish is only lightly coated with batter before breading. Use one hand for wet dipping and the other for dry, otherwise youll end up with lots of clumps in the dry coating ingredients. Place the breaded fish onto the empty plate.When your fish is breaded, heat 1/2 inch of cooking oil in a skillet over medium high. Fry the breaded fish pieces in batches of 6. If the oil is at the correct temperature, it should bubble and sizzle evenlyno splatters or popping. Flip the fish when they turn dark golden brown. It will take 2-3 minutes per side for the fish to become golden and crisp. While the fish fries, whisk together your sauce ingredients. Reserve the sauce.Place fried fish pieces on a wire rack to drain, if you have one. This will keep the fish as crisp as possible. Use paper towels to catch the oil drips underneath the rack. If you dont have a wire rack, you can drain the fish pieces on a double layer of paper towels.When all the fish pieces are fried, assemble your tacos. Heat the corn tortillas in a skillet till they become warm, fragrant, and flexible. Place 2 pieces of fried fish in each taco. Top with a bit of shredded lettuce, some diced tomato, 2 slices of avocado, and 1 tbsp of sour cream sauce. Serve warm with fresh lime wedges.",

  "instructions": "Cut the sole fillets in half lengthways, and then slice each fillet half into about 4 long strips on the diagonal. This will give you 8 goujons from each fillet.                          Put the cornstarch into a shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper. Put the bread crumbs or panko into another shallow bowl, and beat the eggs together in an additional bowl.                          Dip each goujon into the seasoned cornstarch, coating it well, then the beaten egg, and finally the bread crumbs.                          Lay the goujons on a cooling rack for a while, and heat the oil in a pan. (Or at this point you can freeze them in layers of baking parchment in an airtight container.)                          Fry the goujons for about 2 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Remove to pieces of kitchen towel, as you go, to remove excess oil.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maison Noir OPP Pinot Gris with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

  "instructions": "PreparationClean the hard-shelled clams:                                        Scrub the clams thoroughly with a stiff brush under cold water, discarding any that have cracked shells or that are not shut tightly.                                    Make the stew:                                        In a kettle cook the onion, the fennel, and the bell pepper in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened. Stir in the zest, the minced thyme, the bay leaf, the cayenne, and the saffron, cook the mixture, stirring, for 30 seconds, and add the wine, the stock, the tomatoes, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 15 minutes, add the garlic, and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes. The stew may be prepared up to this point 2 days in advance, cooled, uncovered, and kept covered and chilled. Stir in the shrimp and the clams and simmer the mixture, covered, for 5 minutes. Add the crab legs and the scallops, simmer the stew, covered, for 3 minutes, or until the scallops are just cooked through and the clams are opened, and discard the bay leaf and any unopened clams. Divide the stew among 8 heated bowls and garnish it with the thyme sprigs.                                    Make the stock:                                        In a well-buttered heavy saucepan combine the fish bones and trimmings, the onion, the parsley, the lemon juice, and the salt and steam the mixture, covered, over moderately high heat for 5 minutes. Add the water and the wine, bring the liquid to a boil, skimming the froth, and simmer the stock for 20 minutes. Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a bowl, let it cool to warm, and chill it, covered. The stock keeps, covered and chilled, for 1 week if it is brought to a boil every 2 days and then allowed to cool to warm, uncovered, before being chilled again. The stock keeps, frozen, for 3 months. Makes about 6 cups.",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Attems Pinot Grigio Ramato. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars."

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Fish on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Maison Noir OPP Pinot Gris. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 25 dollars."

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Scarpetta Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Preheat oven to 425.Wash and dry fish fillets, then season with salt.Meanwhile, mix breadcrumbs, melted butter, juice of a lemon, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.You will need to spray some cooking spray on the breadcrumbs to make sure they are moist enough. The breadcrumbs should be forming into moist crumbs.Place fish in shallow baking pan.Pour the white wine around the fish, making sure it does not actually cover the fish.Place the breadcrumb mixture evenly over the fish.Put the fish(for haddock or cod) in the oven for about 10-12 minutes, until almost done.You then may want to broil the fish for a minute or two just to crisp up the topping.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Maison Noir OPP Pinot Gris. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 25 dollars."

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Chloe Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars."

  "instructions": "PreparationClean the hard-shelled clams:                                        Scrub the clams thoroughly with a stiff brush under cold water, discarding any that have cracked shells or that are not shut tightly.                                    Make the stew:                                        In a kettle cook the onion, the fennel, and the bell pepper in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened. Stir in the zest, the minced thyme, the bay leaf, the cayenne, and the saffron, cook the mixture, stirring, for 30 seconds, and add the wine, the stock, the tomatoes, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 15 minutes, add the garlic, and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes. The stew may be prepared up to this point 2 days in advance, cooled, uncovered, and kept covered and chilled. Stir in the shrimp and the clams and simmer the mixture, covered, for 5 minutes. Add the crab legs and the scallops, simmer the stew, covered, for 3 minutes, or until the scallops are just cooked through and the clams are opened, and discard the bay leaf and any unopened clams. Divide the stew among 8 heated bowls and garnish it with the thyme sprigs.                                    Make the stock:                                        In a well-buttered heavy saucepan combine the fish bones and trimmings, the onion, the parsley, the lemon juice, and the salt and steam the mixture, covered, over moderately high heat for 5 minutes. Add the water and the wine, bring the liquid to a boil, skimming the froth, and simmer the stock for 20 minutes. Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a bowl, let it cool to warm, and chill it, covered. The stock keeps, covered and chilled, for 1 week if it is brought to a boil every 2 days and then allowed to cool to warm, uncovered, before being chilled again. The stock keeps, frozen, for 3 months. Makes about 6 cups.",

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Villa Sandi Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle."

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle."

Add the carrots and boil until just tender, about 4 minutes; drain. Pour the reserved stout glaze into the saucepan and boil over high heat until thickened and reduced to 1/3 cup, about 2 minutes. Add the carrots and simmer until glazed, about 1 minute.                                              Remove the halibut from the marinade and arrange the fillets on a rimmed baking sheet.

Add the garlic and sweet potato and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the broth and lentils and simmer, covered, until the lentils are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the fish with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cook until opaque throughout, 3 to 5 minutes per side. In a bowl, whisk together the mustard, wine, and tarragon. Drizzle over the fish and lentils.

    "pairingText": "Halibut can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Chloe Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle."

    "pairingText": "Halibut works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Archery Summit Vireton Pinot Gris with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle."

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Halibut. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try GIFFT by Kathie Lee Gifford Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 15 dollars per bottle."

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Halibut. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Argento Pinot Grigio with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle."

    "pairingText": "Halibut can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is FitVine Wine Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars."

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Halibut. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Archery Summit Vireton Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle."

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 26 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Whisk together ingredients for white sauce and refrigerate until ready to use.Combine lime juice, oil and cumin in a shallow nonreactive dish small enough to just hold the fish. Add fish and turn to coat in the marinade. Season with salt and pepper and marinate fish at room temperature for 30 minutes. OR mix dry rub spices together and sprinkle on both sides of fish.Preheat grill to medium-hot. Brush grill grate with oil. Grill fish until just cooked through, about 3-5 minutes per side. Break fish into large pieces.Fill tortilla with fish and desired accompaniments. Drizzle with white sauce and squeeze fresh lime wedges over tacos.",

  "instructions": "In a 3- to 4-quart pan over high heat, bring about 1 quart water to a boil. Add potatoes. Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain; keep warm.                                                                                                 Meanwhile, rinse fish, scallops, and shrimp; pat dry. Cut fish into 1/4-inch-thick slices about 2 inches long. Cut scallops crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut shrimp in half lengthwise. Arrange fish, scallops, and shrimp on a flat dish.                                                                                                 In a 3-quart metal chafing dish or pan over high heat, bring all the broth to a boil. If using a 2-quart fondue pan, fill it halfway with boiling broth (keep remaining broth hot; cover and set over lowest heat on a range).

Spear potatoes or seafood, 1 piece at a time, on fondue forks or thin skewers (metal or wood) and immerse in broth. Cook potatoes until warm or hot, and seafood until barely opaque in thickest part, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Dip hot foods into rouille to taste, or spread rouille onto croutons to eat. If broth stops simmering, return to high heat on a range burner until boiling. Return to fondue burner. As broth in 2-quart pan evaporates, add remaining broth.

    "pairingText": "No one wine will suit every pasta dish. Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish."

Add the capellini and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente and has absorbed most of the sauce, about 5 minutes.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish.

Cut the zucchini lengthwise down the 4 sides, taking off all of the green and about 1/2 inch of the white in each of the 4 pieces. Discard the white, inner section. Cut the rest into -inch dice. Blanch until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain, plunge into ice water, and drain again. Set aside.                                                      Take off the outer 2 layers of fennel and save the rest for another use. Trim away any thin, flexible sections near the edge of the fennel. Cut the firm, thick part into -inch dice. Blanch as with the zucchini.                                                      Scrape all pulp and pith from the preserved lemon and cut the yellow rind into fine julienne. Blanch for 1 minute, refresh in ice water, drain again, and set aside. (The recipe can be made to this point up to several hours ahead.)                                                      Put 2 cups of nage and the mussel stock in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the saffron and boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.                                                      Bring 3 cups of nage to a boil in a 10-inch-wide pot. Season both sides of the halibut with salt and pepper. Add the halibut to the pot and adjust the heat so the liquid just simmers. Poach until a metal skewer inserted into the center of the halibut meets only a little resistance, 5 to 6 minutes, and the skewer, when left in the fish for 5 seconds, feels barely warm when touched to your lip. The halibut will be rare (thinner steaks will be ready sooner). Take the steaks out of the liquid as soon as they are done.                                                      Meanwhile, put the zucchini, fennel, preserved lemon, tomatoes, and shallot in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the capers and the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Just warm the vegetables through, about 2 minutes; do not let them cook further.                                                      To serve, cut the 4 basil leaves across into thin strips. Stir the olives into the vegetables and squeeze the  lemon over them. Pull the skin off the halibut. Reheat the saffron broth, if necessary. Put the halibut in the center of the plates and arrange the vegetables over and around the steaks. Pour the saffron broth around the halibut. Scatter the basil over and around the fish and serve immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                var articleType_27_data = {};                    articleType_27_data.init_step_by_step_images = 0;",

    "pairingText": "Halibut works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Archery Summit Vireton Pinot Gris with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle."

It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars."

    "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Scarpetta Pinot Grigio.

  "instructions": "Using a box grater set in a bowl, carefully grate the cut sides of the tomatoes, stopping when you reach the skin. You should have about 2 cups of tomato pulp.                                              In a large, deep skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the onion and half of the garlic and cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until they are softened and just beginning to brown, about 6 minutes. Add the tomato pulp and cook over high heat until it is thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the clam broth and boil until it is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.                                              Add the serrano, olives and halibut and simmer over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the fish is cooked through and the stew is thick, about 5 minutes longer.                                              Meanwhile, in a small bowl, using the back of a spoon, mash the remaining garlic to a paste with a pinch of salt. Whisk in the mayonnaise, pimentn and the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.                                              Serve the fish stew in shallow bowls with a dollop of the pimentn mayonnaise.",

  "instructions": "In a mini food processor, sprinkle the diced bread with the water and let stand until the water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cayenne and salt and process until the bread and garlic are coarsely chopped. With the machine on, drizzle in the olive oil and process until the rouille is smooth. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate.                                                        In a very large, deep skillet, heat the 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the leeks, onion, fennel and chopped garlic and cook over moderate heat until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook until they begin to break down, about 5 minutes. Add the bay leaves, saffron and pastis and bring to a boil. Add the fish stock and bring to a simmer. Cook over low heat until the vegetables are very tender, about 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaves.                                              In a food processor, pulse the vegetables and broth to a coarse puree. Strain through a fine sieve set over the skillet.                                              Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the lobster and cook until it turns bright red, about 4 minutes. Drain and rinse the lobster under cold water until cool enough to handle. Remove the tail, claw and knuckle meat and cut into 1-inch pieces.                                              Preheat the broiler. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet and broil them 6 inches from the heat for about 1 minute per side, until the slices are golden brown around the edges. Rub each slice with the remaining whole garlic clove and drizzle lightly with olive oil.                                              Add the potatoes and cayenne pepper to the broth and bring to a simmer. Cook over moderately high heat until the potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Add the clams, cover and cook over moderate heat until they just begin to open, about 3 minutes. Add the monkfish, cover and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the lobster, snapper and halibut, cover and simmer until the clams are open and all the fish is cooked through, about 4 minutes.                                              Set a baguette toast in each of 8 shallow bowls. Ladle the fish and broth over the toasts and top each serving with 1 tablespoon of the rouille. Sprinkle with fennel fronds and serve immediately.",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The FitVine Wine Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Whisk together 1 1/2 cups of water, 1/2 tsp of salt, and 1/4 tsp of turmeric in the bottom of a large saute pan. Lay the cilantro, sliced carrots, garlic, and crushed red pepper flakes (optional) in the bottom of the pan. The pepper flakes are very spicy, add with care. Turn the heat to medium low to slowly heat up the water in the bottom of the pan.While the saute pan is heating, pour 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil into a large nonstick skillet. Let it heat up over medium until hot and just beginning to smoke.While oil is heating, season the fish fillets generously on both sides with salt and pepper, then sprinkle them with a light layer of smoked paprika (about 1 tbsp total).When the oil is hot, place the fish fillets into the skillet and sear them for 2-3 minutes on each side till a brown crust forms. When both sides of the fish are seared, use a pair of tongs to gently transfer the fish fillets into the saute pan. Lay them on top of the cilantro and carrots. Turn up the heat on the saute pan till the liquid begins to boil. Reduce heat to medium and allow mixture to simmer uncovered for 10-15 minutes, basting fillets frequently, until the liquid is reduced by half.In a small bowl, mix together remaining 1/3 cup olive oil and 1 tbsp of smoked paprika.Pour the seasoned oil over the top of the fish fillets, coating them evenly. Let the fish simmer uncovered for 20 minutes more, basting frequently.Fish is done when liquid is reduced to about a quarter of what it was originally, the fish has turned red, and the carrots are tender.Season fillets with additional salt and pepper to taste if desired. Serve with cooked carrots and sauce from the pan, garnished with fresh cilantro. Goes great over rice, quinoa, or couscous!",

  "instructions": "In a large, heavy skillet over medium heat melt the butter, then saut the onion and celery (and mushroom, if using) until the onion is soft, stirring occasionally.Stir in the salt, pepper, and sage and cook for an additional 3 minutes.Place the bread cubes into a large, deep bowl.Pour 1/4 cup of the butter/celery mixture over the cubes and toss well, then repeat steps until all of the butter mixture is used.Toss the cubes thoroughly to coat.(Regarding the optional chicken broth: for dry stuffing, add little or no liquid; for moist stuffing mix in lightly with fork just enough chicken broth to moisten dry crumbs.) Let cool and use as stuffing for the turkey.We've made this stuffing in the crockpot, as well, adding the chicken broth for moistness.Adapted from Betty Crocker's Picture Cook Book, circa 1950.Note: regardling the amount of salt - yes, the amount listed above is correct and is what is listed in the original Betty Crocker recipe. When the butter mixture is first added to the bread, if you taste it at this point it might seem salty (because it is sitting right on the surface of the bread) but remember that the liquid and butter soaks into the bread and redistributes evenly. Also, this recipe, being from the 1950s, is specifically for cooking *inside* the turkey, which a lot of people no longer do, and again the salt will redistribute from the juices in the meat. If you use a crockpot for cooking your stuffing, I'd recommend reducing the amount of salt.Note #2: again, regarding the salt. You're going to have to decide for yourself about the salt. Having eaten this recipe for every year of my life I know it tastes wonderful as it's written. But that's just me.",

    "pairingText": "Fish can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Season the mackerel with salt and white pepper and arrange the pieces in a 9-by-13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish, skin side down.                                              In a large saucepan, combine all of the remaining marinade ingredients with 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer until the vegetables are just tender, about 20 minutes. Immediately pour the marinade over the mackerel, spreading the vegetables in an even layer. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate overnight.                                              Transfer the mackerel fillets to plates, skin side up. Top with some of the vegetables and a drizzle of the marinade; serve the potato salad alongside.",

  "instructions": "Basically, what you are doing here is building a big box of buttered bread, a little home for your eggs. Start by removing a slice about 2 inches (5 cm) thick from the loaf. Cut off the crusts from the slice, then remove its core by cutting a square hole in the middle. Keep in mind that the hole has to be big enough to contain three scrambled eggs and the delicious fish. Preheat the oven on a low setting. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a nonstick frying panor better, use a breakfast griddleover low heat and slowly color the box on all sides. Put the box on a plate along with the fish and place the plate in the oven to heat the fish and keep the box warm. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, and a little salt and pepper. Scramble the eggs over low heat in the remaining butter in the same pan (or a new pan if you used a griddle for the bread). When they are almost set, nonchalantly add the warm pieces of fish. Heat the ensemble through. Place the ensemble in the box. Garnish with the crme frache, chives, and horseradish. We also find a teaspoon of caviar to be a nice touch.",

    "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars."

    "pairingText": "Fish can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try GIFFT by Kathie Lee Gifford Pinot Grigio.

    "pairingText": "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Luna Vineyards Napa Valley Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.                          Cut the fish into 1-inch strips and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with lime juice.                          With a rag or paper towel, grease the grill with oil to prevent sticking. Place fish on grill gently; and cook for 3 minutes on each side, turning carefully with tongs.                          On the cooler outer edges of the grill place the tortillas to warm them. Transfer the warmed tortillas to a plate or a wide shallow bowl lined with a clean kitchen towel. Fold the edges of the towel over tortillas to keep them warm.                          To assemble, divide the fish among tortillas and top with salsa verde and avocado slices. Squeeze lime juice over the avocado and roll up the tortillas.                          Salsa Verde:                          Recipe courtesy Bobby Deen                          Remove papery husks from tomatillos and rinse well. Cut in half and place cut side down on a foil-lined baking sheet. Place under a broiler for about 5 to 7 minutes to lightly blacken the skin.                          Place tomatillos, lime juice, onions, cilantro, jalapeno peppers and sugar in a food processor or blender and pulse until all ingredients are finely chopped and mixed. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use.                          Serve with chips or as a salsa accompaniment to Mexican dishes.",

Rub the fish with the spice paste and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours.     Light a charcoal fire or preheat your gas grill on high. Oil the grills cooking surface. Let the coals burn down to a medium-hot fire or adjust the gas grill burners to medium-high.    Grill the fish until just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and coarsely chop.    Divide the tortillas into 2 stacks and wrap each in aluminum foil. Place on the grill until heated through, about 5 minutes.    In a large bowl, combine the green and red cabbage.    To assemble the tacos, take 2 tortillas, top it with chunks of fish, a dollop of the sauce, a spoonful of the Pico de Gallo, and some of the cabbage. Squeeze a wedge of lime over the filling, fold the tortillas, and eat.                  Author's Note:       Meredith Deeds grew up in San Diego and taught me the ins and outs of the fish taco. These are an adaptation of her moms recipe.                Photo: Brian Hagiwara          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews",

    "pairingText": "Fish works really well with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The FitVine Wine Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Cut fillets into 2 inch chunks and drizzle with the lemon juice.Pour the beer into the bottom of a saucepan (if using fresh lemon juice, toss the leftover lemon rind in with beer) and place a collapsible vegetable steamer over the beer.Bring the beer to a boil, place the fish chunks in the steamer, cover and steam for 5 to 10 minutes, dependent upon the thickness of the fish.The fish will be rubbery if it is overcooked.Meanwhile, heat the butter with the garlic and salt (I heat it slowly until the garlic is no longer raw).Remove the fish from the steamer and discard the beer/liquid/rind.Serve the fish chunks with the garlic butter dipping sauce.",

    "pairingText": "No one wine will suit every pasta dish. Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish."

  "instructions": "Squeeze the lemons into a large bowl of water. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, snap off the outer leaves and trim off all but 1/2 inch of the stem. Using a sharp knife, cut off the leaves at the top of the heart. Peel the base and stem. Using a small spoon or a melon baller, scoop out the furry choke. Add the artichoke to the water and repeat with the remaining artichokes. Thinly slice the artichoke hearts and return them to the water. Drain and pat dry.                                              In a large, deep skillet, heat 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the oil until shimmering. Drain the artichokes and pat dry. Add the artichokes to the skillet and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned in spots and barely tender, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook over low heat, smashing the tomatoes, until the artichokes are tender, about 5 minutes.                                              Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving 3/4 cup of the cooking water.                                              Add the pasta and the cooking water to the skillet and simmer, tossing, until the liquid is nearly absorbed, about 2 minutes. Stir in the parsley.                                              In a large, nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil until shimmering. Season the fish with salt and pepper and add to the skillet, skin side down. Cook over high heat, turning once, until crisp and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the pasta to a large platter and arrange the fish on top, skin side up. Serve right away.",

    "pairingText": "Fish on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Argento Pinot Grigio with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "In a saucepan, cover the potatoes with the water and bring to a boil. Cover and cook over moderate heat until the potatoes are tender, about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered.                                                                                                Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add half of the onion and garlic and cook over moderate heat until softened, 5 minutes. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Add the mussels, cover and cook over moderately high heat until they open, 3 minutes; transfer to a bowl. Add the clams to the saucepan, cover and cook. As the clams open, transfer them to the bowl. Strain and reserve the cooking liquid. Remove the mussels and clams from their shells and coarsely chop them.                                                                                                Wipe out the saucepan. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the bacon and cook over moderate heat until crisp, 4 minutes. Add the celery and the remaining onion and garlic. Cover and cook over moderately low heat until softened, 7 minutes. Stir in the flour, then gradually whisk in the potato cooking water. Bring to a boil, whisking, and cook until thickened slightly. Add the potatoes and the cream and bring to a simmer. Add the salmon and monkfish and simmer over moderate heat, stirring a few times, until the fish is just cooked, 3 minutes. Add the mussels and clams and pour in their reserved cooking liquid, stopping before you reach the grit at the bottom; stir until heated through. Season with salt and pepper and add the parsley. Serve the chowder in bowls.",

Season with salt and pepper.                                                    Arrange half of the prosciutto slices on a work surface, overlapping them to make a rectangle large enough to enclose one of the monkfish tails (use enough prosciutto to enclose the monkfish securely; you may have a couple of slices left over). Lay the fish in the center and fold the prosciutto up and around it to make a tight roulade. If necessary, secure with butchers twine or toothpicks. Repeat with the second tail.                                                    Set seam side down on a plate and refrigerate for 1 hour.                                                    Preheat a gas grill or prepare a fire in a charcoal grill. Place a piastra  on the grill to preheat.                                                    Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt. Set up an ice water bath.                                                    Drop the fregola into the boiling water and cook until just al dente. Drain and immediately refresh in the ice bath; when it is cool, drain the fregola extremely well.                                                    In a large bowl, toss the fregola with the pesto and red peppers. Set aside.                                                    Brush each prosciutto-wrapped tail with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Place on the piastra and cook for 6 minutes, unmoved. Gently roll each one over 90 degrees and cook for 4 minutes. Repeat twice, for a total cooking time of about 18 minutes; the internal temperature should be about 150F in the thickest part of the fish. Transfer to a platter and allow to rest for 10 minutes.                                                    Cut the tails into -inch slices and arrange nicely on top of the fregola.

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Villa Sandi Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 10 dollars."

  "instructions": "1 Remove the sardines from the cans. Using a small, sharp knife, carefully open each one down the belly and back, folding them open to expose the backbone. Remove and discard the bones. Cut away and discard any tails. Set aside.2 Place the cream cheese or Neufchtel in a medium bowl. Fold and stir with a rubber spatula until smooth. Add the shallots, scallions, fresh herbs, and most of the lime or lemon juice, mixing into the cheese with the spatula.3 Add the now boneless sardines to the cheese mixture. Use a fork to smash the sardines and stir into the cheese. Add cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste. Add more lime or lemon juice to taste.Either serve immediately (Dorie suggests chilling at least 2 hours, but I haven't found that necessary), or chill. Can make up to two days ahead if you carefully cover with plastic wrap so there is no exposure to air, and chill.Serve on crackers, bread, celery sticks, or as a stuffing for cherry tomatoes.",

  "instructions": "Bring a very large pot of heavily salted water to a boil.                                  Open the sardine tin and drain a tablespoon or so of the oil into a wide skillet (the amount of oil in the tin will vary by brand, so add additional extra virgin olive oil if necessary to make up a tablespoon).  Warm the oil over medium-low heat and add the garlic, cooking until fragrant.                                  Trim the fennel and slice the bulb very thinly (a mandoline works great here). Add to the skillet with a sprinkle of salt, raise the heat to medium, and cook until the fennel is soft and beginning to caramelize.  Add the chile flakes and let them sizzle for a minute, just until fragrant, then add the tomatoes with their juice.  Cook until the liquid is reduced, then add the vermouth and let that reduce slightly.                                  Add the sardines to the skillet with the tomato and fennel mixture, breaking up slightly but leaving some chunks.  Zest the lemon and combine a tablespoon or so of zest with the toasted breadcrumbs, then set aside. Juice the lemon and add the juice to the pan. Taste and adjust salt if necessary.                                  Add the linguine to the boiling salted water, cooking it until it is just short of al dente.  Using tongs, transfer the linguine to the sauce to finish cooking, adding a little bit of the starchy pasta water and tossing gently to combine. (You'll want to leave this a little wet, as the breadcrumbs will soak up the sauce and dry the pasta out a bit once you've added them.)                                  Transfer the pasta and sauce to a large warmed serving bowl (or individual pasta bowls), add a drizzle of olive oil, sprinkle on the toasted breadcrumb-lemon zest mixture, and garnish with picked small fennel fronds and the remaining lemon zest.",

  "instructions": "1. Clean and trim 1 bunch spinach.You want to break off the root end (see right hand), leaving just the leaves and as much stem as you tolerate (see left hand). You can save the root end for stock or compost 2. In a food processor, puree together peanuts, dried sardines, and soumbala.Peanut pieces are much cheaper than whole peanuts, so I buy them in bulk for cooking.I couldnt find dried sardines, so I used smoked anchovies.You cant tell from the picture, but I was telling Keith to hurry up and take it already.He took his sweet time, relishing the sight of me squirming about with the fishies.I shouldnt have been so squeamish. Ive filleted fish. Ive boned a lamb shank (all at the Culinary Institute of America). But dried fish are on a whole other level.I guess thats what this Adventure is for.Hello little guys. Lets get acquainted!Heres the soumbala. It was frozen and I put it in the food processor that way with no problems. I really enjoyed this, despite the strong odor. But, then again, I love anything fermented  stinky cheese, wine, bread,Puree until the mixture looks like coarse sand. Or fine gravel.3. Add 1/2 cup white rice and process another 20 seconds.Some of the rice will break into smaller pieces which will contribute to the the characteristicgelatinoustexture of the final dish.4.Add all ingredients (including spinach) to large pot with water. Simmer, covered.After about 15 minutes, give everything a stir to mix the spinach in.Doesnt look too hot yet. Dont worry.Simmer another 15 minutes.The rice will have absorbed all the water, making for a pasty mass of spinach and rice.Serve immediately, with a confident smile.This recipe was fascinating! Thank you Burkina Faso Special Thanks to Jeannette M. who helped clarify my rusty translation from the French. Without her, I very well might have thought this was a beverage. Ok. Not really. But thank you Jeannette for suggesting what greens to use.

    "pairingText": "Salmon can be paired with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Francois Carillon Bourgogne Chardonnay.

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Yellow Tail Chardonnay with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 8 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.Cut the greens off the beets, leaving about  inch of the stems still attached. Save the greens for another time. Wash the beets well and place them in a roasting pan with a -inch layer of water on the bottom. Cover tightly with foil (if the foil touches the beets, cover first with parchment, then with foil.) Roast about 50 minutes (or longer for larger beets). When the beets are done, carefully remove the foil. Allow them to cool, and then peel them by slipping off the skins with your fingers. Cut them into -inch wedges.Slice the stem and bottom ends from the blood oranges. Stand the oranges on one end and, following the contour of the fruit with a very sharp knife, remove the peel and white pith. Work from top to bottom, rotating the fruit as you go. Then hold each orange over a bowl and carefully slice between the membranes and the fruit to release the segments in between. Squeeze any juice left in the remaining membrane into a measuring cup. Add any juice from the bowl of blood orange segments to the measuring cup. (Or if you're pressed for time, just slice the oranges into rounds.)Combine the diced shallot, lemon juice,  cup blood orange juice (if you didnt reserve enough, you can add regular freshly squeezed orange juice), honey and  teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Whisk in the olive oil slowly. Add black pepper and additional sea salt to taste.Remove the salmon from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature. Season the salmon with the zest, sea salt, and ground pepper.Heat a large saut pan over medium heat for about 1 minute. Add the oil to the pan and allow to heat up for 1 minute, until very warm, but not smoking. Lay the fish in the pan, seasoned side down, and cook 3 to 4 minutes, until it is lightly browned. Turn the fish over, lower the heat to medium-low, and cook a few minutes more, until it is almost cooked through. Do your best not to overcook the salmon. When it is done, the fish will begin to flake and separate a little, and the center will be slightly rare. The salmon will continue to cook a bit more while it sits.Place the spinach in a bowl and toss lightly with some dressing. Transfer to a serving platter. Place the salmon on top of the spinach.Place the beets and blood oranges in the bowl and toss lightly with some dressing. Arrange the beets and blood oranges around the perimeter of the platter. Drizzle the salmon with additional dressing, if desired.",

    "pairingText": "Salmon can be paired with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Whisk first 6 ingredients in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish to blend for marinade. Add salmon; turn to coat. Cover and chill at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.  Preheat broiler. Line heavy large baking sheet with foil; spray with nonstick spray. Remove salmon fillets from miso marinade; using rubber spatula, scrape off excess marinade. Arrange salmon, skin side up, on prepared baking sheet. Broil 5 to 6 inches from heat source until skin is crisp, about 2 minutes. Using metal spatula, turn salmon over. Broil until salmon is just cooked through and golden brown on top, about 4 minutes. Transfer salmon to plates, skin side down. Spoon Cucumber Relish over. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, then sprouts and nori. Serve immediately.",

  "instructions": "To finish, spray a non stick pan with cooking sprayI use the same pan Ive cooked the greens in and place over medium high heat. Once hot, add salmon and reduce heat to medium. Cook until bottom side is golden, about 4 minutes, flip and cook another 3 or 4 minutes. (Total time will vary according to thickness of filet and how well done you like your salmon.)Squeeze a bit of lemon over fish and serve with Ginger-Garlic Greens and Shiitake Mushrooms.GINGER-GARLIC GREENS AND SHIITAKE MUSHROOMSThis makes a large portion of greens and mushrooms and could probably serve two but, to be honest, when Im really hungry, I can devour the entire plate myself!1 bunch greens, rinsed, leaves stripped from tough stems and torn into pieces5-6 oz Shiitake mushrooms, sliced or whole1 to 2 heaping T minced garlic1 to 2 heaping T minced ginger2 T seasoned chicken broth1 t toasted sesame oilsalt and pepperFresh lemon juice, rice wine vinegar, red chili flakes and/or soy sauce, optional.Spray a large non stick pan with cooking spray, add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and stir fry over medium-high heat for about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and ginger and cook 2 minutes more. (Youre adding garlic in last 2 minutes of stir frying so it wont turn brown and bitter.)Add 2 T chicken broth and greens and toss with tongs (rubber tipped if using a non-stick pan!) until greens begin to wilt. Add a little more broth if cooking tougher greens like Kale.Sprinkle with salt and pepper and sesame oil, toss again and taste for seasonings. (Notice youre adding oil last, not cooking with it..which lowers the calories of the dish and preserves the taste of the sesame oil that would otherwise be diminished by the heat.)Add fresh lemon juice, rice wine vinegar, red chili flakes or a little soy sauce to enhance flavors as you like. Top with Sesame Salmon and serve.PLAY WITH YOUR FOODUse any sort of greens that are fresh and in season where you live. If you like a tender and mild green, use spinach or chard; if you like things spicy, try mustard or turnip greens. For a more substantial green, try chopped bok choy or kale. (Again, if using a sturdier green, you may need to add a little more chicken broth for the healthy saute as they take longer to cook.)If youd like more color and crunch, toss in slivers of red bell pepper as you add the greens. If youre craving more protein, add a 1/4 cup of frozen, shelled edamame.You can also experiment with the seasonings: adding more garlic or more ginger or using a little mirina sweet Japanese rice wine instead of, or mixed with, the broth; or can even brush a little Hoisin Sauce or Thai Sweet Chili Sauce on the fish in the last minute of cooking.Play around, have fun and find the combination of flavors that you like best!RE-USE, RE-PURPOSE, RE-CYCLEIf youve really paid attention to your serving of salmon and kept it to 4 ounces, you probably wont have any left( and least I never have..!)But you may have extra greens and mushrooms and they are golden for your inventory.Add them to a Skinny Veggie Omelet, or toss them with some broth, soy sauce, a bag of 20 calorie a cup soy noodles, and 3 or 4 frozen shrimp for a quick soup.Super skinny, super quick and delish!",

    "pairingText": "Salmon on the menu? Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Yellow Tail Chardonnay with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 8 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Mix the mirin, brown sugar, and soy sauce in a shallow dish that will hold all 4 salmon fillets. Stir to dissolve sugar. Place the salmon in the dish and marinate for 5 10 minutes, turning once. Meanwhile, set a very large non-stick skillet (or two smaller ones) on the stove and heat over medium-high heat. Place the salmon fillets in the hot, dry pan  nice sides down  and cook for a few minutes until nicely seared and coated with a rich brown glaze (keep a close eye on the pan; this happens quickly). Turn the fillets over, reduce the heat to medium, and add the marinade and water to the pan (if using two pans, add marinade and water to both). Cook 3-5 minutes more, until fish reaches desired doneness. If the sauce looks like its reducing or thickening too quickly, just add a bit of water a few tablespoons at a time. Do not let it burn. Transfer salmon fillets to serving platter or plates. If sauce is nicely reduced and thickened, turn off heat. If not, continue to cook over medium heat until desired consistency is reached. Add the rice wine vinegar to the sauce and stir. Pour the sauce over salmon fillets, top with scallions and serve.",

Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Kumeu River Mate's Vineyard Chardonnay.

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Salmon works really well with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Foley Estate Winery Sta. Rita Hills Chardonnay with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Preparation                                                        Combine mussels and wine in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover and cook until mussels begin to open, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer mussels to large bowl (discard any mussels that do not open). Pour liquid from saucepan into 2-cup measuring cup. Stir in saffron. Let cooking liquid stand 15 minutes.                                                                Add enough cream to cooking liquid to measure 1 1/3 cups. Transfer to large saucepan. Stir in tomatoes, garlic, bay leaf, and cayenne. Simmer over medium heat until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill mussels and sauce separately.)                                                                Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add salmon, rounded side down. Cook until bottom is golden, about 3 minutes. Turn salmon over. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until salmon is opaque in center, about 4 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Leave covered to keep warm.                                                                Bring sauce in large saucepan to simmer over low heat. Add mussels in shells; stir until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in lemon juice.                                                                Place 1 salmon fillet on each of 4 plates. Divide mussels among plates. Spoon sauce over salmon and mussels.",

  "winePairing": {
    "pairingText": "Salmon works really well with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Chateau Ste. Michelle Chardonnay (Anniversary Label) with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle."
  },
  "instructions": "Put the salmon, skin-size down, on a large sheet of plastic wrap in a container large enough hold the salmon in one flat layer (The salmon will exude more liquid - make sure the dish you're using has sides high enough to contain any drips: rimmed baking sheet, roasting pan, large Tupperware container, etc.).                                  Drizzle the salmon with the ouzo. Mix together the remaining ingredients and rub on the flesh. Wrap the plastic around the fillet tightly, trying to keep the liquid inside the plastic. Cover the fish with a cookie sheet, plate or some other flat item (you want to weight the fillet down, so make sure it's entirely covered. Weight down the sheet with a heavy item (a can, bag of flour, cast iron skillet, etc.) . Place the salmon in the refrigerator for one to three days (the flavor gets stronger the longer it cures).                                  Unwrap the salmon and pat it dry. Using a very sharp knife, slice very thin slices across the fillet. Garnish with citrus (I used kumquats and some dill fronds). Serve with carrot tzatziki.                                  Mix all the ingredients together. Adjust salt to taste. If you need more tartness, add a little more lemon. As the tzatziki sits, the garlic flavor will become more pronounced. For best results, make this the day you intend to serve it.",

  "instructions": "Set a small perforated pan, a flat-bottomed colander or strainer basket, or even a cooling rack or a broiler pan in a baking dish or similar container to catch drippings. Line the perforated pan with a large piece of cheesecloth, allowing the edges to drape over the sides of the pan.    Remove the pin bones from the salmon and put it skin side down in the center of the cheesecloth. Brush the lemon juice and vodka (if using) evenly over the salmon. In a small bowl, mix the salt, dill, sugar, and pepper. Pack this cure mixture on top of the salmon in a thick, even layer. Wrap the edges of the cheesecloth around the salmon to loosely bundle it up.    Choose another pan thats roughly the same size as the salmona loaf pan, for exampleand put it on top of the salmon. Add about 2 lb. of weight to the pantwo 15-oz. food cans work wellto press the salmon and help it exude moisture. Refrigerate for 3 days. Gently brush off and discard the cure.

    "pairingText": "Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Santan Ema Reserve Chardonnay with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle."

  "instructions": "Preparation                                                    Cook shrimp and make shrimp butter:                Cut each shrimp shell lengthwise along back with scissors, leaving last segment of shell intact, then devein shrimp, keeping shell in place. Rinse shrimp and pat dry, then sprinkle with salt.                                                                            Heat butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté shrimp, turning once or twice, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer shrimp and butter to a sieve set over a bowl and, when just cool enough to handle, shell shrimp (leave shell on tail segment), reserving shells and butter. Chill shrimp, covered, until ready to use.                                                                            Return shells and butter to skillet and reheat briefly to liquefy butter, then transfer to a food processor along with Cognac and water. Purée until as smooth as possible, about 2 minutes. Force mixture through a fine sieve into a small bowl, discarding solids, then chill shrimp butter.                                                                        Prepare salmon:                Curl each salmon slice into a circle, skinned sides in, and tie with string to hold its shape.                                                                            Cut 48 (3/4- by 1/16-inch) strips from truffles and mince remaining truffles, reserving liquid if using preserved truffles.                                                                            Make 6 evenly spaced slits in top of each salmon slice with tip of a small knife, pushing a truffle strip into each slit. Sprinkle salmon with salt and chill on a tray, wrapped well in plastic wrap, until ready to poach.                                                                        Begin sauce:                Simmer Chablis with shallot in a 2-quart heavy saucepan until reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes. Add cream and return to a simmer. Pour through fine sieve into another small heavy saucepan, pressing on and discarding shallot. Add minced truffles and any truffle juice and simmer sauce until reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, about 5 minutes. Stir together arrowroot and Cognac and whisk into sauce. Simmer, whisking occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes, then stir in salt and pepper.                                                                        Poach salmon:                Butter bottom of a deep 12-inch heavy skillet and arrange salmon in it. Add 1 cup wine and enough water to just cover fish, then top with a round of buttered parchment or wax paper, buttered side down. Bring to a simmer over moderately high heat, then reduce heat and poach at a bare simmer until salmon is just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes from time heat is turned on. Transfer with a slotted spatula to plates and remove string.                                                                        Finish sauce:                While fish is poaching, combine sauce and cooked shrimp in a heavy skillet and bring to a simmer over moderate heat. Add shrimp butter and swirl skillet until butter is incorporated. Season sauce with salt and pepper and serve with salmon.",
